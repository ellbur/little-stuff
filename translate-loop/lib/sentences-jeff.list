why do owen's nails bring out the worst in you
that's really weird, but whats even better is that this is the usual    response to owen
He really makes people either heavily amused (me, the entire robotics    club, and other really nerdy people) or brings out this amazing anger    (everyone else)           ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh     is it Evan Dinger
because he seems to really like you     just handing you the ball practically, and picking you first for his team     he's pretty cute eh
haha     i was going to bring it up today, but it seemed pretty mean to say, and    then i completely forgot about it
what i thought was pretty ironic was that the subject of this is just ONE    day early to apply to the exact situation you're in
remember, chill
oh and
you may want to avoid me tomorrow     i'm protesting
through clothes     so
yeah, just avoid me if you can (its a lot easier now that we have    like no classes together)           you know what the problem may be
you dont listen to music nearly as much as is healthy     there's callllllllllmmmm music, and there ANGRY music, and there's music    that makes you want to dance (the best kind
And
you can find them ALL in your favorite beatles album
and if you dont have a favorite beatles album, i highly suggest their    early hits (that's when they're happiest and most upbeat and about love &    such
later on they get a little grumpier and such
probably because the were still british when they did that
and    then they became super hot american loved
or something     well i dont know my Beatles history so well, but they're great
and its    SO SO hard to find someone who doesn't like them     so you need to find a Beatles album and listen to it and get unstressed    today     (sorry, i forgot to put that idea at the beginning of the paragraph
but    its at the end, so its ok
Sometimes i forget people arent all thinking    the same thing as i am
It's pretty annoying, because i'll jsut say "istn    that wierd
People have a habit of getting REALLY pissed at me, and then feeling bad    about it and trying to apologize (this is the thing with Sasha too
that's a really good example) but i basically completely forget a few    seconds after it happens, and continue to think of them as perfect, fun    people
So then, when they try to apologize, i tend to make an ass out of    myself and be like "what happened
so sorry about that (if you    noticed)
BUT on the plus side
that same sort of thing (i think) give me amazing    powers to basically stop the world for a second or two
For example one of my friends is having a bit of boy troubles, and is    really sad (crying a lot
and for a half second she looked at me and smiled like she meant    it because I had really goofy hair this morning and i got it to do some    tricks
and then i felt really awkward, and the world sort of crashed into    an oppressive silence
but for a bit, everything was normal
I managed to do it again when we all brought up an interesting    conversation about air hugs (a girl was helping me
if it were just me    things would have been a lot more awkward)
It turns out i'm the inventor    of the air hug, and the only one who actually enjoys the practice
can i    help it that hugs are just 1000x better than
hey you meanie
got me    all hooked on the other thing (i refuse to name it
hugs ARE better :P)     And another friend popped out of the bathroom, with another girl    comforting her
she too was crying
I noticed, but instinctively, i    smiled and waved
and for a second, she just responded to my regular    cheeriness and gave her usual jeff-wave
i feel so loved) for a second, life was normal,    her conversation stopped, her tears held their place, and then it jerked    back into motion, and things were awful again
if you want a bit more detail into the whole sasha story, here we go
otherwise, you'd better grab a bowl of popcorn, a quiet corner, maybe a    couch, and your Beatles cd
Well, remember Tuesday's meet
well, Sasha falls down a lot
She fell down two meets ago
survived last week somehow :P and just hurt    herself on Tuesday
Of course, it really hurt and pissed her off, i mean, its her second    falldown
So she looks all grouched out, and then she says with great attitude "Do    you have my time
i ask (no
it wasn't "can i have a hug
but it came out anyway     "i'm not angry its just that i dont see how i can PR when i fell down
Its    just not right
the first or second    ones are the ones that come out most oftenly
but the third one is the    nice one)     But i kept quiet
and she suddenly realized what i said
basically was randomly angry (what a crappy race
stupid girls being too    good to run for REAL when i can actually do something with my swimming    lungs and all my cheering powers
which btw, you should join swimming,    its probably good for your knee-that's why Christian joined last year, and    he did pretty well in swimming AND track- and you should NOT go super    "lets race" mode when its the finish between you and Jen and the next    person is miles back
i must've had some emoflakes for breakfast    today :P)     annnnnnnnyways
so then there was rosie who was totally un-pissed at me    again
so i was pretty happy about that
and that was good because    also her mom and also pretzels and then we went on the bus and had a party    "i'm just waiting until SOMEONE
says something" Richard says
leaving a huge pause
we all laugh because we all put money on kelsey
and then he squeaks the bench about a million times and    (who-would've-guessed) Kelsey freaks out and screams
it was great
and then there was a lot of positivism on the bus, and Dave read "turkey    trot innocence" and didn't take to it as much (wasn't as funny/goofy as my    stories usually are
and much shorter too :P)     anyways, we get back to the school and it feels like a big party
everyone feels good, and the world is at peace
and then I come out, and find Jamie
But she's talking to Sasha
and i    always feel awkward around Sasha
so i wave at Jamie, and as soon as i    see Sasha turning to see who Jamie's looking at
i turn away and act as    if I never saw the two
Jamie laughs and invites me over
Soon, there i am grinning and we all get somehow into a weird    conversation
The only thing i remember is that Sasha was saying how she tripped and she    couldn't really focus after she fell, and showed us her injuries
Jamie say "oh sasha
haha, i love you
don't worry, I love you too
that's me, everything's    cool, dont worry about it" motion
Sasha kinda just smiles and looks at me a little sideways
Personally, i    like to imagine she was trying to read whether i was actually interested    in her, or i was just a freak
That might've been what her and Jamie were talking about before i showed    up
That'd be nice, wouldn't it
I almost fell on her (haha that'd be    funny) and then she let me slide back into a stand
the whole time i was    sort of really conscious
sasha probably was watching this craziness
Well, that is
if everyone in the world being happy is crazy
i bet i caught you being pessimistic
haha
Jamie starts    shoving me off, and i really have that crazy "hurry up and    hop/skip/jump/run/jog, but dont get confused, and give them all your    excitement
but I also have this "i'm a big baby
because she    has a backpack on
because i have all my junk on me
and Jamie's over here pushing me and pulling me, and trying to get me to    ditch my stuff and give sasha a hug
and sasha's standing over there    pretty as a tree (yes pretty as a tree
its the first analogy i could    come up with
well then
some real madness starts going on because i realize i have to    go over there anyway because my locker is right by hers and also she's    dropping her backpack and REALLY looks pretty as a tree and is now    physically accessable for a hug
and i have jamie pushing me
so i hop    then skip, then take about two jogging steps, and then shuffle and then    walk over
and SASHA
grrrrrrrrr
puts her backpack back on
So i go to my locker, and put away my stuff, and she walks right up to my    locker
sorry for being mean to you
but its done
people can tell when they're    in person
How I look like i'm really angry or    something
Everyone does it
I guess it's just the way my face is
haha, it was so    great, because it really didn't have anything to do with her face, she    sounded so angry about doing well
not only that, but she had a legitimate    reason to be angry
I was walking down the hall with sasha
we    were going back to the gym, (I was supposed to be headed off to the front    entrance
about 5 minutes ago
But you know, i'd much rather have been walking with Sasha
So i did
Instead of just laughing at her, i really got what she was saying
People look at me sometimes, and ask "what's up with you
Most of the time i'm full of life, and completely    irrepressible
so when i'm sitting quietly
something TRAGIC must've    happened
Something important, something big
Something that REALLY got to    me
Telling sash' all this was an interesting thing
It was like there was a sudden connection between us
we had something    in common for once
I mean, i'm a pretty goofy, optimistic    kind of guy right
Remember last week when you asked 'you alright
you're    not as chipper as you usually are'
I dont really know why
I    guess it's because i remembered the part where she said "chipper" and    that's a really cool word and i love it when people actually use cool    words that nobody ever uses
I guess she notice me looking down at her, because she started grinning    right back at me
Everything was jsut all happy and perfect
I bet he's going to go kill himself tonight or    something
jsut like that it was gone
The one bridge that linked us    together faded away and i was left feeling awkward
Usually when this    happens, i either A) try to run away, B) cover myself up and try to    disappear or C) hold someone's hand
Sometimes i'll just find something    new to say, but when i feel awkward, people around me notice
This time i got all kinds of confused and tried all three at once
and    then was saved by Tiff being in the same hall     whew
I got her involved in a conversation
and disappeared as soon as    i got a chance (i think right after i turned back to go where i was    ACTUALLY going Sash' said "what was the point of that
6
no matter who you are, or how many    times you order things from vending machines, you will ALWAYS say the    letter and number out loud
its weird that way     anyways, she punches in the numbers (well, number and letter) and the    little tray stirs to life     whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr     it lifts off the ground
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr     gets to the D line
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr     goes straight past it and begins to vend B-6 instead     Haha
Jamie flips out
instead of getting really good/sweet juice, she's stuck    with raspberry hinted Dasani
I just laugh and laugh and laugh
I try to get Christian to laugh at her too (HAHAHHA, hey christian
ask    jamie what just HAHA happened
and when my dad asked "why were you so late" i said "hmmm    i guess i just mis-estimated the time it took to get back to the school
So me and Jamie were talking about boyfriends and girlfriends and the    troubles that ensue
I already knew that all my problems are mostly my    fault, but Jamie's aren't really her fault
Probably because its her guy's    fault
Hah
Anyway, this is what I came up with:     "Is that the `official' difference between guys and girls
so i moved it here)     so yeah, that's my story
i have another one about Jared
JARED NESPOLI
one time i was going to write an EPIC NOVEL about 100 pages in length    going into deep analysis of all the really big heroes on X-C and Track    that i've met
Jared was going to be one of them     and then
I was going to put in that he was the first of the people i met that    seemed normal
Like Kita was a GOD in middle school when i first met him,    but Jared was flesh and blood
and in track we were pretty close (time wise)           well anyways, my Jared story is about the race yesterday (race:10/10/06)     it's a deep plot
hopefully
Lets see how it comes out     (btw, in case you're wondering, i've decided to abandon NHS and Community    Service and Homework and Studying and PSAT prep to write stories for    you
when its for you at least they get done
and they're a lot better    than the ones i've done recently for nobody
but    sometimes that's where we're going
For one
Jared gets all the love
I mean, Marissa totally had something    going on with him, but who knows if anything ever happened
these things    tend to stay away from my knowledge
Rosie and him
FREAK THE BAJEZUS    OUT OF ME
enough said
Those two need to get a room or something
or i    just need to leave and stop being jealous
probably the second one,    knowing me
For two, Jared is always right there in front of me
We're pretty close,    so we can get pretty competitive, even though we're probably tied for    "biggest slacker" award
In track i have a bit of an advantage, so i    really want him to join track
We also have ENTIRELY different running styles
way back when, Jared was my super pace-clock person     but now that i've run thousands of workouts, i can pace myself unless i'm    totally exhausted
Jared is really consistent
so he doesn't have a good sprint finish
I'm    kinda floopy and random, so obviously i do
he's really good though, so he generally wears me out and gets a good    lead- enough to hold me off usually           so yesterday's pace race, i thought "what better fun than to go say hi to    my best friend Jared
Mike's my best friend, i ran with him all freshman year, so we're tight
Which brings in the question
why am i fast now
oh well
So, the first mile, i got stuck in a crowd, and decided to push Nick    Hanson for a bit, then after the mile mark I grouped up with Noah, and    right by the two mile, Hunter told us to stop fooling around with the DEAD    TIRED Noah, and move to the next pack
it would be a nice pickup
So the    next pack was Mike and a bunch of our team
so we SWARM him and we all shout
a lot     we're about to enter the last mile of woods, and only like two guys go    past us
and they have to wiggle through our pack pretty dangerously
the woods     and we just CLOG it up
Everyone's constantly screaming at him "go up the    hill
attack the hill
NOW TURN
take a right
Come on mike
LETS    GO MIKE, LAST MILE
DOWN THE HILL DOWN THE HILL
Use the downhill
catch    up to Pat
just look at the back of his neck
Just a little more, You got    this
Watch out for roots
MAKE A MOVE NOW
KEEP IT UP
DONT GIVE    UP
We definitely worked Mike to    the bone
But we made a really funny clog
Ian from South dropped by and    said hi, and since we werent really working i was just like "hey whats    up
I thought it was just    three more South guys, but one had on a slightly different green jersey
Richard was the one to point it out "ITS STIENERT
OMG EVERYONE FREAK    OUT
Our group sort of twiched
stopped shouting for a second
and started    sprinting off completely ditching Mike with just a few more "ALMOST    THERE"s and "YOU'RE DOING GREAT"s
I lingered behind, but it soon became clear that Mike had given it    everything he had and it was starting to be questionable whether he would    be able to finish without passing out with the intense exhaustion
We    worked him to the bone
I wanted to wait with him
maybe even physically    push him to the finish (Mike wasn't just verbally pushed in the woods,    everyone kept hitting him on the back and dragging him along
he was    basically abused
SEXUALLY haha jk)
So, as I get on the last straightaway, i finally look at MY position
There's just this big spacy line of South kids, then me, then my shadow    (from stienert i think) and then a guy who just recently overtook Mike,    then the Mattlack himself
completely exhausted
So
i look for my best friend Ian
I guessed he was in the South line
so i sort of start moving
I just pick it up to a race pace, and i start    coming up behind south
Jared's mom waves and cheers, but she does it    jokingly, so i just wave back
i'm not tired
Then i get a glimpse of Jared, going onto the last curve on the road
and i see the South kids all get oriented into a tight, perfectly straight    line on the right side
and i think
JARED
I break into a sprint, ignoring the really obnoxious clicking of the    mini-spikes i have on
I'm tearing down the last bit, and suddenly its like i'm the only one    moving
the South kids, perfectly alined flick by
There's a little space between the 6 south kids i just passed and Jared
and i wasn't sure whether ot be a nice guy and just jog it in with him
or have him face a goofy, humiliating defeat on the sprint
I decide to take the middle ground and
and Jared starts to turn his head
and     ZOOOOOOOOOOOOM i'm passing him and laughing
I finish at practically mach speed and turn around
and laugh some more
i hand in my card, Jared next
then the south guys congratulate me
before seeing my goofy smile and completely non-tired expression           Also
earlier that day Jared kept making fun of me for liking Sasha    (which i didn't just come out and say, i said "man i REALLY wish i was at    the 2 mile mark, seeing as this race doesn't even matter for me and Sasha    was running pretty badly
she could use some cheering" then everyone got    the pretty obvious message and BOOM a rumor was born
but technically i    never said it
it just happens to be true
i got him back kind of
2 min on 1 min off for the whole course
i    could NOT surge at all
it was pretty bad
Jared dropped behind because    he tied his shoe
then didn't have a watch
i could've used his    super-pacer abilities
I finished my breakfast and everything  and i'm about to go
when my dad    pulls out the sports section and lets me check out the results
i skim down
and there it is
12
Nespoli 18:30     oh man oh man oh man     ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh mannnnnnnnnnnnnn     i cant wait
11
L
Baumbach     WTF     OMG     WHAT THE FUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCOOOKIE
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR     RSLKGJ:SKLGJ:KSCN<>C     ok     im good now     what the heck     so not cool           Then, when Jared found out     "Hey, the proof is gone
Jeff, you just missed your one and only chance to    EVER have your name in the paper"     that's cold Jared
that stings
Rosie laughs at me     Jared gets all the love
We're going to have a giant orgy on you     Are you excited
I'm excited     come-on Jeff, let it out     SEXUAL INNUENDO

that displaced biking for coldness
omg you phycho
shoulda invited me to go swimming :P     you know what pisses me off
a lot of times i fantasize about doing butterfly
i think its too much    running and not enough swimming
but then
of course i dont want to go swimming, because that involves    nakedness
gasp
yeah
and just for the record, what was going through your mind when you    were already freezing and decided to go swimming
haha, i had 14 and a 1/2 today actually :P     silly henry, why did he ever even try to compare
btw, we should have a contest to see who's better at turning negatives    into positives
I've noticed we both do it a lot
For example you'll be    like "just because i'm so special right
well,    "special" happens
or you'll say
So
emphasis on AMAZING,, right
not so much awkward
when i say Amazingly awkward
and I do all sorts of strange things in language, i dont really know how    to discribe it
plus, in my conversation with Archie, she kept being like "i'm not    marissa, and you dont flirt with me
only with marissa
its like you invite me    in while pushing me away
Theres a pretty good song by a rather sexy    artist that says that from the girl's perspective
Name: Skye Sweetnam,    Song: Tangled up in Me
so i told her
and then pretty soon we were on a    discussion on how pretty Archie's eyes (and the rest of her too) is
and    she was kind of enjoying it until she started trying to pretend she didn't    like it and was all like "jeff, you flirt too much will all these girls,    so i cant trust you" and i was like "well, 10 minutues ago you didn't    believe that and said i only flirted with Marissa
and what was even better, was i started pulling out all this crazy stuff    that proved EVERYTHING she said was wrong (how my complements to her    didn't count, and how i wasn't interested in anyone but you, and all sorts    of things she tried to come up with
she just decided to    flip out at me and say what was basically a "no
i'm not getting    involved" sort of statement
it was pretty harsh, but for the longest time i was taking everything she    could throw at me and convincing her that it was wrong
to which i said "that's not true, you said i NEVER flirt with    you")     hey i just realized that i wasted an entire day
alright
score
btw, wear you're new blue run for wrobo shirt tomorrow, EVERYONE's doing    it and we're going to match
hahahah it'll be funny

Doesn't that suck how    i can find some pretty decent evidence out of a couple of statements like    that
It's just the highschool thing to do: being last minute, not finding    evidence out of nothing
but you know what REALLY sucks about going into highschool
when i was a wee little kiddo, i worked my butt off in school and i did a    lot of work
now i'm suddenly realizing that NONE of that matters
See,    you can just jump right into an advanced math course after ONE year of    hard work, and i get shoved into this school's retarded "lets waste our    time" math courses
but it's kinda fun because i just hang out with    Amanda and Sarah the whole time
they're both going to get pretty fed up with me in the near future, and    for the rest of the year they'll be like "JEFF

Ya gotta catch me on a good day
yes
i know
haha i have to tell you something about being optimistic sometime     just remind me and say it involves sasha
i'll remember (unless you say,    "you know you were going to say something about something with sasha

Recent things:     5/26/07 Steph's birthday
an interesting time
Basically it was me and all    her friends
it was sort of like the crowd that I COULD belong to
but    always felt like they were too good
Plus, I'm a little to the side
sort of
Hopewell is hot and long
and sneezy
Meg
Templon says I'm an alright kid
not just Marissa's    creepy ex
Power went out at night
I asked 8ball if steph was mad at me:    outlook not so good
Whatever
Next day I sat with THE sasha Murr on the bus
No way
Steph is cuddly anyway
but kinda pissed
later on she says "I think it's a little early to be feeling this way
see "brainwashing begins"
7/30/04     I think that most of the problem is that I don't know how to handle    myself
To most of the people reading this, that probably seems like the    most obvious statement ever made by me
But seriously, I'm the most    boneheaded person I know
Here's a few examples
A long time ago, when I still was crushing on C
S
Problem is, I live in a fantasy world where    magically burning things is an everyday event when someone pisses you off
Really, what am I supposed to do if things inexplicably go perfectly as    planned in my head
So anyway, it was mentioned in passing that she hurt    her arm
Mostly I was doing the passing and she was doing the mentioning,    but I stopped every now and then to make fun of the fact that she worked    hard to get muscle, where I was happily weak to a 1st grade level
So the    plan was to push open that fat heavy door leading out of Spanish class
Just about to do that at the ring of the non-existent bell, I clumsily    trap myself into my own desk attempting to hurry up
Struggle with my    books for nearly a minute and look like a general idiot
Later I told her    that entire ordeal, making a good side conversation
See, its not really all my fault     This second one has been nagging me for quite a while now
In fact, its    been flat out stabbing me in the ass; coming back periodically to haunt me    or occasionally hunt me
Here we are, all of us
Just sitting, eating lunch, having little    conversations
Nothing out of the ordinary
Only thing is, two days    previous, Megan A
got a new haircut
I don't remember how she looked    before, but I noticed immediately when she got it, and noticed an    improvement
So anyway, my little interjection to the conversation is how    amazingly kewl konversation is
I go on about how longstanding my    (lol) complementing goodness has been, when all of a sudden people start    barking at me about my total ignorance to my own actions
Again, living,    like I do, in a fantasy world, I have no idea what they want from me
I    mean, the things that they say about me
Anyway, I
forget
but the point is that I said that it "looks like a    naked mole rat went up on your head and exploded
for all you slow readers out there
Obviously this was a very controversial statement, but in my own defence,    complements have to come to you, and since one didn't, I forced it, and    that's just plain stupid
wait
Then of course there was the whole rest of the year, and that was just    plain, all out, retarded on my part
Since I have SEVERAL hours to burn, I    figure that I can write the entire Goldman Chronicles, go back, revise    them, take a few "creative liberties" and still have some time left to    burn them if they really suck since I got tired halfway through
9/29/09     The paradox of meeting shy asian girls
They're always hiding, so I would have to be UN-shy to meet them

11:22pmJeffrey     yes, i am seriously NOT harassing anyone     this should come as a shock     i meant that last statement sarcsastically, but you might not consider it    that way     also she's back on     11:41pmOwen     but
no that's not it     11:42pmOwen
11:42pmJeffrey     she's on right now     11:43pmOwen     but
11:43pmJeffrey     she hates you
11:44pmOwen     no     she's busy and neither of us have anything to say     it's just a green circle in the dark     11:45pmJeffrey     how about     you just say something like "damn girl you're fine, we should hang out    sometime"     and then discuss the literary merits of said statement     it rhymes     you could always ask her to rate something on a scale from 1-10 and argue    with her     11:46pmOwen     merits
it has merits
11:46pmJeffrey     or actually attempt to see things from her point of view, which may be    valid
if you wanna be boring     and yes     it does     11:46pmOwen     why would I intentionally bug her when she's doing something else
11:46pmJeffrey     it rhymes     because u wanna talk to her
11:49pmJeffrey     how do you feel on the whole "shy asian girls are always hiding" issue
i feel like a detailed analysis on that may help you out     11:50pmOwen     OK     I think
I don't know many shy Asian girls     11:51pmJeffrey
yes
just think about it     11:53pmJeffrey     nothing
11:54pmOwen     um
I plead the 5th
I think     I think
11:55pmJeffrey     geez     ok     so     think of it this way     the conventional methods of meeting people:     they live on your floor     for you and me this does not apply     all male floor and dont go out of suite     and then     consider meeting in class     they are too shy to start a convo     and also, normally are hard working     so will not be interested in talking to you while class is going on     and after: they tend to disappear, along with everyone else, and are    generally not meeting people there     also: do not go to parties     if that were a valid option for us, it would immediately be ruled out    anyway     also:     engineering doesn't have any     further limiting     etc
so     the only solution     for meeting shy girls (in particular asians)     is to actively seek     Today     11:59pmJeffrey     especially in hiding places     or working places     such as a library (which you joked about)     or dsv lab     which lee said     12:00amOwen     I can no concentrate now     12:00amJeffrey     that's why ur chatting w/ me     duh foo     anyway, the reason i like shy asian girls, besides the infinite cuteness     is because they can relate to being shy and thinking deep things alone     12:01amOwen     I
have to get off FB before my mind explodes     12:01amJeffrey     but
i would have to actively change myself to a socialite to meet them     ok     fine     geeeez     bye
Try to think logically
Wanna hear a joke
Ok, so a man is walking down the street
He's all dressed up, with a full    tuxedo and hat
He looks great, and everything, and he comes up to these    two girls
And the girls are fighting with each other and crying
So he comes up to them and says "Hey little girls, what's wrong
The moral of the story
Don't trust girls
Ok, once upon a time, there was a wise man who was praised across the land    for his ability to think logically in any situation
Men of all ranks    would come to him when they had a problem, and he would always say "Let me    think about that one" as he stroked his chin
When he had the answer, he    would say "Well
Logically, there's only one answer
One day, a group of bandits decided to kidnap him
The wise man was well    known to be open to answering any man's questions, despite who was asking,    so there was no reason for this
The bandits snuck up behind him, and placed a bag over his head, then tied    him up and carried him away to their hideout
When they took the bag off his head, they didn't say a single word besides    "You have seven hours to live
How would you like to die
The bandits were shocked
They hadn't untied his hands
But he seemed to    be no danger, so they locked him in the room by himself and guarded the    room for 7 hours
When the head of the bandits returned, the guards said that they hadn't    heard a sound from inside
They unlocked the door, and the bandits asked    him for his answer
To instantly kill me, take the sharpest    sword and the strongest man you can find
Cut from in front of me when I'm    blindfolded
Be quick and go straight down the middle of my head
This    will sever my brain in two so I feel no pain
Continue through the neck    and back, splitting my vertebrae and spinal cord
On the way, be sure to    hit my corodic artery and heart so that blood spurts out in a graphic, but    painless and effective death
After you clear my ribs, sweep off to your    good hand before you reach the hips
And for two, I really don't want my balls to be cut off
Put it away and get to work
The next day:     "Is this related to your English project
It doesn't look like it
isn't it
The next day:     OSS
i just    thought you should know     Marissa
you get me so crazy sometimes (most of the time)     you've been with me for so long
it's not going to be easy to just stop     theres a piece of me that keeps saying "i cant do this" but i really dont    know what that means     i cant be with you
i cant be without you
i cant tell you anything
i just dont know anymore
the thing is
you're a dangerous person     last year
i tried to not get involved with you again
i made myself    rules
and you broke every one with just the sweep of your hand
i just
cant shut you out of my mind     and for now, im stuck at a place where everything is just so mixed up     i wish i could just call you and say "you and me
we're a good thing"    (in kevin's words), but where would that get us
stuck on opposite sides    of your parents' walls
and after that
would i be any different
would you still just get bored    with me and leave again
i think so
but im still here wishing that somehow things would work
i cant do this
but i really want to     (and, to make matters worse
i dont even know how i feel
i am just    screwd up on the inside)     another message I never sent
Runner @ heart     I need some maps in here     Crazy moments:     Warinanco -Sophmore Year- THOUSANDS of Acorns are littered abound
SO
we do the natural thing
shove them down people's shirts     We eventually make our
subjects
so incredibly fat the shirts were    getting ridiculously stretched out and such
Christian had to do the    "pregnant walk" and Kita was just hilarious as a fatty
Spring Track- Freshman Year- Dave Siuta, after a minute of practicing in a    corner, asked everyone "HEY is this how you do B-skips

He misses the ground: his leg swings wildly and he just hammers into the    ground
Everyone points and laughs
It was great
3/21/06     My dentist     Today instead of doing distance running
I slacked off and did jumps     But I did have a good excuse
dentist appointment at 5
so leave at    4:30     My dentist and I have a fun conversation
got any plans for this summer
ummmmmm running
camp
I could never do something like that
sprints or
long distance
I couldn't do that
The most I've ever gone is like 5    miles
In short "when you sign your first shoe contract
Think of the guy who    cleans your teeth
Hipple     Tuesday, 4/25/06 (track season)     It was against Steinert
we won our first meet of the season (1-3    record
Well, first of all, mass confusion as to where exactly we were
We got    there without taking any wrong turns or anything, but everyone was like
OK, we're in Hamilton
but there's like three schools in Hamilton
PG (Paul Genevisi) clarified which was which, but I didn't really follow
West, East, North
we PASSED the North
so its not that one
it was    kind of random
Also, we passed Red, White, and Blue
the swim team's goofy apparel    store
a thrift store with a bunch of random things
organized by    type
then color
We passed by Siperstien's Paint Store
shaped like a giant bucket of    paint
interesting
I forget
Things go pretty regularly
but the girls are first    (kind of random)
Well, then comes the mile
Now I'm in this
So its me, Matlack, Pat,    Nick, and Dave
As the gun goes off
Matlack completely PWNS everyone
He's all alone
Then
their top runner jumps up with him, and we get a    nice look at the back of his red hair (natural)
Then
we realize that    we're going REALLY SLOW, and everyone leaves me
So now we have a giant pack of four
their guy right behind, and then    me
and we still seem to be going real slow
Then, Dave PWNS everyone, and our team follows
Dave, I guess, wanted to    win pretty badly
so he takes up an actual race pace
We sort of thin out by the 3rd lap
and it's our top three, and us other    three in a pack
I decide that I don't want to be left behind, so I play a    little catch up
It feels like I simply slowed everyone else down,    because I don't feel tired, but I see myself catching up easily
On the    last lap, I think about catching up, but don't really feel like it
so I    do that little passively trying thing (its when you think about it so hard    that hopefully your legs will catch them for you )
Well, last 200 comes    up
and Pat starts to give it a nice jog in
and I make an insane mad    dash to get him
I was easily 50 yards back, and I start revving it up
By    the last straightaway, I feel like I'm fresh, and doing a sprint
I'm    really hauling ass, or Pat's just jogging it in (probably the latter)
I'm burning up the track
zooming up
I'm practically right behind him,    and I see him pick it up a little
Then
someone screams "PATTTTTTT HES    RIGHT ON YOU
it was seriously as if he was the only sound in    the entire place, so
Pat sort of give his 10 yard sprint to hold me    off
and we TIE
I thought I might have gotten him
having him only give a little push at    the end, and me full speed with at lean to get the win
washsda;jflka (was it)" I ask the official
pointing to us    two
I was a little short on breath for the second, so I had an excuse
I'm like "ok thanks
So goes my defeat
but with immense    awesome
I broke 5 for the first time too
I also didn't feel the race at all, except that I was breathing hard    during it, and my butt hurt a little after it too (left side)
Other than    that it was the easiest race ever
So for the rest of
forever, I will always say "I was THIS CLOSE
And skip    school) was in two days, and they couldn't decide who was going to be the    fourth part of the 4x8
It was obviously Meg Fitz, Marissa, Claire    (wait
I thought it was    Sarah, no contest, but she's been injured
Maggie had a beastly first 500,    and Sarah looked like she was going to die
then the tables turned and    Sarah ended up zooming up with an opponent and getting second like 30    yards in front of Maggie
Crazy race
Richard went zoom zoom during his 800 (2:06 I think
quite quick)     Mike Stellino went BAM BAM BAM during his 200 (false start by miles
and    the other guy didn't stop until the third time the gun went off
they both ran the 3200
and Richard was burned
and Stelino was    a sprinter
So it was the goofiest thing ever
Stelino got a good time
um
12:15ish
Lol     The girls also ran the 3200
But they were goofing off
They used it as a    work out
and did one lap jog, half lap run
Claire and Marissa
with    Anna
It was goofy
Marissa was talking every now and then, Claire    (supposedly) shot faces to random people, and Anna though she was about to    die
Marissa got 2nd at 12:99:99 (one of their girls just slipped away on    the first lap
Our team was jogging
or maybe
It was strange
4/27/06 Thursday     All of our coaches were at Penn Relays for the Girls, and I was about to    leave for 4 days on the Annapolis Band trip
so practice was really BS
They (who
I don't know) told us everyone to go for a 20 minute run
So I    was like YES
until they said "except for distance, you go for 40    minutes
Well, the day before I had a rough time
doing Kunkel-No    Trespassing
and ended up at an hour
going amazingly slow through the    Pennington School's track, with only the general idea of how to get back    to my school
Life's tough
So this day's practice, already BS, started off with a bit of confusion,    but we finally grouped up and left
We got to the stoplight, and there was    Jamie, Abby, and Anjina
So
I enjoyed a nice 25 minute walk to Abby's house, some ice cream, and    a ride back
We talked about all sorts of things, and Jamie and Anjina were stealthy    like, and stowed away in the pickup bed
leading some random person we    passed (they knew her, and waved) to be smiling and laughing as we passed
Strange day
9/1/06 Friday     Lets just start by understanding this: some of our girls are not the    brightest
I don't know exactly when this was
it could have been as much as a week    ago
but it is by FAR my favorite Megan Fitzpatrick quote
and yogurt
AND peanut butter
I might be remembering the wrong thing
but I just    hear the first part and start laughing
a runner of her level
eating    nothing but tiny Cheerios made me laugh
and
the peanut butter was with    this amazing enthusiasm
like
she couldn't remember eating anything
and then suddenly "I GOT IT
this next story is a lot more concrete
don't worry
We were warming up for hill repeats yesterday
well, lets just see as if    it were today
8/31/06 Thursday     Today was Hill repeats
as Thursdays usually are
but recently our    warm-ups have been to run the course
instead of just 20 minutes in the    woods
So, as our usual tradition is walking for five minutes
we were kinda    slow to get going
As we got under way, I found myself at the head of the    pack
so I slowed up and waited
and waited and waited
To get past the two soccer fields at the start
took about 2 minutes to    the usual one
Well, this seemed to be fine, and I didn't complain
I just settled back    with everyone else and somehow we made a human wall, trapping the girls    team behind us
along with our two rather unhappy coaches
I think helping his brother unpack)
Well, we headed into the long    stretch with all the reeds/long grass/whatever it is, and at this point
I realize I'm going to be hearing Kelsey's voice for the rest of the    run
but at this point, I don't really care
It's not like she's THAT    annoying, I figure
I had a REALLY hard time    distinguishing her regular whiny voice from the whine that usually comes    with this sort of sarcastic comment
I'm not sure whether she was    serious or not
BTW, this brings back memories of a two mile we did in track last year    (sophomore year)
The first 100 found me in the front
so I took the    inside and slowed down
as we rounded the first turn, we all broke into    chatter about how we SHOULD keep this nice casual talking pace
but we    wont
eventually someone passes me
and brings us to the same exact    pace
and finally as we finished the first lap, Matt and two members of    another team break off and the REAL race starts
I donno if that's    a real word, but she interjected it
but I'm just saying
in NO WAY help me figure    out if she was sarcastic or not
She could be serious, and kinda    indignant to Meg reading her wrong
or she wasn't, and indignant anyway    because she was just pointing it out
Hard girl to figure
Well anyways
we run around for a while, maintaining the human wall, to    the anger of our coaches
and we space out a bit more
letting some    girls come up with me
but not much changed
Except
I was REALLY tired of hearing Kelsey, I pushed my way forward    after the first big uphill to try to get her voice out of my ears
but    it really carries
Christian and Richard had a fun time with the branches that hung into the    road
Christian would run through them
and they would flip back and    smack Rich in the face
starting a humorous conversation
As we came up to the same reed/long grass/junk road
Meg says
It's going to be SO    cold
It's supposed to be sunny this weekend
very quietly
as if it being sunny would make the beach    ANY more bearable
NJ beaches are FREEZING
score is 2-0 for her
I call this a foul
We'd    better go today
Meg says "As if one day is going to make a difference
Basically
our girls are retarded
It took at lot of effort not to laugh
Friday 9/1/06     You know what makes me angry (I've had this thought for a while now, so    just bear with me)
How Milk is not a runners food
Sure
it's a liquid    (and can therefore not be anyone's FOOD), and Sure it makes you run really    terribly, and Sure it provokes the need to drop a
well, you know
But still
it should be a runner's food
Milk, btw, is good
I really like it
Now this seems like a random,    juvenile statement, but sometimes (however rarely) life is just that    simple
Girls, however, are not
but that's something ENTIRELY (well,    technically not
girls make milk) different
The point is
Milk has    everything you need in it
Nature designed it that way
Before humans were    around, Little Chimps all around the world were sucking down milk like    there was no tomorrow
Do you know why
Because it has EVERYTHING you    possibly could need when you're a little chimp trying to become the alpha    male
the Silverback, or what have you
Why did I bother to tell you that
Because
if Milk has everything you    need to grow up to be big and strong
why can't you drink it on race    day
It doesn't make any sense
According to one of the X-Treme guest speakers
but it COULD be because milk contains proteins and    fats
which should not be consumed before competitive events
You just    want masses of Carbs
Well, although I will give Nature a standing ovation for her work on    milk
Human (actually, a lot of animals have this problem) design was a    bit flawed
Seriously, if it's so good for me
why can't I
Well, besides the fact that during and after races, your blood is masses    in your muscles, and hopefully not in your stomach (it helps get oxygen    and your body's good sugars into muscles and lactic acid out
so you    want your stomach empty, otherwise your blood will get confused going two    places at once and you will feel awful) I personally see no reason why    humans should have been built without the capability to handle Nature's    miracle drink before racing
In fact, Runners (and all athletes) are recommended to drink either water    or Gatorade about 30-60 minutes before their race/game/whatever
WHY NOT MILK
Say you're a baby cow
happily drinking milk (it's good stuff)
Well,    you know for a fact that because of milk, you will become a healthy,    strong cow
who's bones and muscles will benefit from the nutrients    and
other good stuff that's in milk (for a complete list
see someone    smarter than me
it could be difficult to find one :P )
Well, it's too    bad that this won't happen, because 20 minutes later a hungry wolf sees    your little herd of cows and organizes his pack
By now you've had a nearly a
hour of digesting that milk, and you see    the pack of wolves
The herd starts to run away, but ALAS, you drank milk and are now    suffering from a severe cramp
WHY
Because fats and proteins take FOREVER to digest
and now you have    a bunch of them in your stomach
Your blood is in your digestive organs    instead of in your legs
when you start to run, you don't have enough in    your muscles OR stomach to use either effectively
You suffer from cramps,    immense pain
and slowness
Those Wolves have never found an easier    meal
LIFE ISN'T FAIR
WHY CAN'T YOU DRINK MILK BEFORE A RACE
THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY
9/30/06     In a Application for College
Jamie had this to say about running
They consider it an act of self-inflicted pain, even punishment
It is    hard to describe to them Exactly why every morning I lace up and attempt    to run faster and farther than before
Even when she looks at    it and realizes how ridiculous it might sound to everyone else, she still    believes it
Even she sometimes wonders how the pain is fun, but really,    she knows that half the fun is seeing how much discomfort you can take
I really agree with her
Sometimes we look ridiculous
On Friday, a couple of Sasha's friends were walking down the hall
One of    them was trying to rationalize Sasha's commitment by saying "That's what    they DO in cross country
they run 5 miles for no reason
I don't know why, but    it amazes me that sometimes 9 miles is just an easy day for me
Yeah
and I just realized I said that
What I meant to say is you'd be amazed    by how you get used to it, and you just want to go faster and farther to    feel the same burn
10/20/06     At Brown
I won 1st place JV     But more importantly, Meg Fitz and Pat got mono
And Oldfield had a nice talk with Fitz about "sucking lips" with boys
It was pretty funny

or maybe you missed the first S and hit H instead

which    all the cool kids say instead of history
or maybe HuSami
English test: he apparently gave us a massive hint during Wednesday, but i    missed it
The point is, you didn't, because you told me
and so did everyone else    this morning
the only important gossip (since not a single person has told me ANYTHING    about ANYTHING except for this) is that Rosie apparently wanted to be my    friend, its just that ever since she started avoiding me
i sort of    looked the other way when she passed so we wouldn't have any awkward eye    contact (which always resulted in both of us pretending it didn't    happen
its basically exactly what i thought would happen, but i didn't    do my plan as well as i could have (be nice to her all the time, in case    she finally turned around
i've been kind of a bozo
So he's going now (and Blake    still refuses to ask me
but that's ok)     that's about it
the end
just for kicks, i'm going to give you a little random piece instead of    doing the work i should be
Tricks     1) whenever you meet someone, make sure they meet you too
For example
a lot of people remember me as the one with the really bad memory when it    comes to names
And for a guy, that's alright, and now i have lots of    friends that go REAL easy on me whenever i screw something up
Also
i    kind of have the bad habit of stealing things occasionally
so i    sometimes get a few points for that
A short list     Lunch table/Kelly/very vaguely Rosie : Hand sex
its a private joke
Kelly: "this is all your fault"- response is usually "well then STOP    FLIRTING WITH ME"     Everyone (on track/my classes/friends of friends): JEFF
we've been in    the same class/ on the same team for SO LONG
how can you not know me     Everyone in my classes: you ask the wierdest questions sometimes
Spainish class: STOP FALLING ASLEEP JEFFE
Chem: HAHA you got thrown out again
Math: god, you always call out
so annoying     Elementary school: the sketchball the teacher hates     Middle school: the nerd with the goofy hair     Rosie/Eva/Kristin: the freepy stalker guy
Lisa: attendance buddies
sort of"= you mean    "lovers
Track/XC: goofiest kid on team award/ one who chases butterflies and    floating dust/ easily amused/ HUNTER
wait TWO HUNTERS
Swim team (minus Erin
because she doesn't know i exist ) "cute little    bear" it was
yeah
a lot of random
my brothers/Ben/some random people with big mouths and small brains:    Marissa's whipped little doggie
jk     people used to know me as the hug guy
but i havent done that in    forever
2) whenever you THINK its a sign
you're wrong
Except if you don't act    on it
then it probably was
but you'll never find out
I'm still    trying to figure out what to do with this
3) mimicking is one of the most fun flirt games that was ever invented
You copy them
they pretty much always go to touching you so you bail    out
which is good for if you just    want to be friends (try to remember trick #2 when all this is going on
if you stop
they'll usually start doing it to you
in    which case you have a free pass to feel their body and blame it on "it was    to get you to stop copying me
4) Miss Congeniality
enough said     5) (i havent gotten to try this one yet, but
followed by kiss kiss
Why
i dont know     ----spin off---- when someone says "i have something in my eye" you    smoothly remark that eskimo's use their tongues to get stuff out of    eyes
sets you up for a french
and the "oops, i missed" remark
6) (this worked amazing in a movie called "de-railed") "i bet you $20 that    i can kiss you without touching your lips" ohhhhhhhh really
Kiss kiss
it works
I'm kind of in the middle of testing this
8) (for girls only) "god im so flat
can you even see these
I think i've looked every time    before going "would you mind
sometimes it really    makes you sad to be a guy
or a distraction while the entranced dude is getting set up
you used to blow me away with your eyes, but you've been a bit    kinder lately
Its amazing what you girls can get your eyes to do
Boys
well, i'll have to see what i can do with those things
Powerful stuff if    you know what you're doing
10) time + contact = comfort
some people will never be
ummmmmmmm    well, cozy, but it helps to get there if you don't rush anything
and
even without "coziness" you kind of have to be around every now and then    to be friends
11) hugs
love the hug/hate the hug
Still need to figure out how to hug    good
last few with you have been awkward
thing about hugs is that    everything changes
a hug is not so simple
if i ever knew how to be good    at hugs, things would be immensely better
Anyways, the hug can be used as    a test
so far, i havent really failed the hug test except for about 4/5    times     (emily, megan, eva-round2, lisa, and someone i cant really remember, but    it was a friendly-but IMMENSELY AWKWARD hug
and therefore was a    miserable failure
who am i to turn down a hug
so technically i've given passing hug    test grades in the past
But most of those people are just the friendly    type
well, that's about it     12) as you've told me, plans are good sometimes
but lately, as i suddenly    have realized, i've been REALLY slacking off
well, a long time ago (back    when i actually wrote) i had thoughts and imaginings and all sorts of    good, creative mental processes
That's pretty much WHY i wrote
to keep    them all down and stuff
but you (and hormones, and lack of time) have    sort of slowed all that down
I used to have rarely a thing that i did not    sort through before doing
now
everything is kind of on the fly
For    example
Wayyyyy back when, if Rosie were mad at me, i would sort things    out and come up with A) a way to say hi, and make sure she doesn't avoid    me, and it isnt TOO awkward, B) something vaugely apologetic, so that    things cleared up, and C) about 1000 variations, with likely responses,    and all sorts of cleaned up phrases, so i knew what i could fall back on    if things got dicey
They were also pretty cool in my mind
but usually    didn't sound as good once i actually said them
well, none of that has been going on lately, and its mostly been whining    about how she hates me
but, you know, usually im too tired to wave too
and havent gotten anything sorted out yet
so yeah
basically plans    would work
and i used to have such a good imagination
oh and before i forget
i'm a thief again
you're SUCH a bad    influence
you and your
well
being good
anyways good luck
i probably took like 2 hours out of your studying    with my 'little' list           and no
i'm not even close with the band thing
because i've refused    to lose sleep over it
except for that one time, because i felt guilty about being lazy
i'm glad i still feel guilt
otherwise things would be bad
13) quarter trick= hands
I haven't mastered this, plus, its not like    holding their hands is that great of a kick unless you already like them    (therefore not good for the whole MEETING girls thing this was meant to    be)     14) Stealing is bad: you look like an evil sketchball
which is not    good
Girls don't like
4/15/06     "I miss being happy
I almost never bring up a    topic of discussion that is pretty serious
But, that's the thing that ran    through my head as I was holding on to Blake's arm, slightly off balance    (when am I not
I think I'm losing my ability to walk in a straight line),    and resting against her shoulder
Maybe its because that sort of thought has been running though my head a    lot recently
I miss being the old me
the one everyone expected to be    happy all the time
That was WHO I was
And now I'm someone else
I'm the    person I used to feel lurking about inside myself
I knew this sort of    thing was coming
But now it's here, and I'll just have to deal with it
Now, I'm shy
Quieter
I don't want anyone to care for me (but, of course,    I'm sad when nobody cares about me
everyone's had that sort of feeling    before)
And
I don't sleep well
I'm tired all the time
I'm pretty    sure I'm dumber
I'm a lot pissier
I don't give hugs to anyone anymore
And avoidant
That last bit is the worst of it
and pretty well sums up    a lot of the rest of it
It surprised me when Blake said "Yeah, me too
I guess I missed that
2 more years
She only has the rest of this one
Then we can try to be    someone new in college
Or, we can get used to the worn out people we've    become
By the way, one of my personal pet peeves is when life turns around    ironicly
I was all ready to SERIOUSLY ask Blake out when she sort of    crushed me with a very true joke
She said "yeah, well, what would we do together
Run around in circles    like idiots
basically
I wasn't very good with the whole sexuality thing
I sort    of just liked hanging around someone and giving them hugs
And the only    ways that sort of thing is socially acceptable are A) if you're a cute    female, B) if you're bf-gf or C) if you're just weird like that
maybe    because you're old friends, or maybe because things are just better that    way
Well, later that day
maybe later that week
I was at her locker again
I was kind of trying to get her to ask me to prom
It was (surprisingly)    actually kind of working
And then I ruined it
it would be a lot of fun if you were there
except that
and there was nothing I could do about it at this point)     "we would be sort of just looking around the room awkwardly and being like    `So
It really just sucks
I wonder if I'm any good at hiding my emotions
I was just lying in my bed
and (this happens a lot) a lot of memories    kept triggering up to me and I had my usual defensive reaction to them
using a physical motion to help them pass through my mind and away from my    attention
I don't remember when I started, but I think the first few times I did it    on purpose
Now It's just instinctual
But
Here we go on one random thought
I wonder if I'm any good at hiding my emotions
Do you ever wonder about that
First of her crying last year at sectionals
Then to her    random super-exuberance that I was completely thrown off by "Hi Jeff
what
hi
me hopelessly trying to    fight against her emotions and mine
The only thing that made it an even    remote success is that it really was freezing that day, and she needed a    jacket
I didn't even say a word
But then I hopped back to me
She's seen me at all kinds of weird times
Sneaking around the corner with Blake
Walking me back to my locker on weird days
Chipper
probably overhearing all the times I freaked out about how cute she was    (can't even handle it
What does she see
What does anyone see
I've never had much use to hide my emotions
No need for any of it    usually
I'm probably not much good
my voice probably sounds sad a lot of the time
I think I'm rather obviously physically affected by things
my actions (I think) aren't ever "normal" enough to be read and based off    of
I don't know though     So
Am I any good at hiding my emotions
Some things you just have to see for yourself
Abby     It's easier to tell the truth when its disguised as a lie     "How do you know I just haven't changed
Why DON'T I want hugs anymore
Jaworsky     Just to see if I could     Dark retake of the jump     STEAL Elise     SOME THINGS YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF     Chest bandage     I always thought it would be cool to have a chest injury     That way I could have one of those sweet chest bandages
The ones that go around your body like 30 times and cover you from pec
to    ab
One reason: body conscious     Another reason: because it would look totally badass     Third reason: it would look totally badass     I thought of this a lot more when Sophie made fun of me for wearing a    "tight shirt"
She kept, jokingly (though you can never be 100% certain    with Sophie), saying that I was really hot
Actually, having my arms exposed all day was kind of cold
I was also    wearing a chain, and a lot of people thought that was funny too
haha good one HVCHS
Very General, in a kind of non-specific way
That's the way I think I write
Maybe even the way I think I think
But I think that I'm smarter than that
I think I've created someone else in my head
I'm sure somewhere inside me    is someone normal
And instead of getting the briefest flashes of insight    and never being able to articulate them, I could, if I try hard enough,    get that part of me out
I don't see things in my life as matching up
I just know they do, and I    can use that pretty well most of the time
And afterward, I think about it    all and say "there's no way this could have worked if I didn't remember    ____ or think about ____
Do things work    like that for everyone else
I kind of wonder about that
Sometimes I'll have something go through my mind
It whizzes by so fast    even I can barely see it
But I'll know its there
And if it's funny, I'll    laugh
But I don't really know what it is until I look for it
I'll see an image
I'll know it's funny
I'll start laughing
And then    I'll figure out what just happened
I hope the other side stays with me
He's a lot better at everything    probably
Well, anyways, I'm supposed to be writing an essay, but I don't want to
So I'll probably just wait around until it gets itself done
4/21/04     I've done some things that I'm not exactly proud of, but some things I    don't have control over either
I don't know if it's just a part of me    that I can't get rid of, or just a part of me that i name as something    else and pass the blame
What I do know is that this is an apology
And a    flyer for my website
Wherever you are when you read this, please don't sit down and cry
Or    hunt me down and gang beat me all at once
Or do anything that you would    have liked to do
Just think of me
Nobody can help me, but    everybody feels this way
I'm not used to being alone
And I wouldn't wish    it on anybody, now that I know what it feels like
I thought briefly of    just disappearing from all of you, so that I could leave you be and not be    missed
But, we all know, or at least I know, that I can't keep away from people,    and can never keep a straight face for more than five minutes
And I know    that I can't change my very soul to reflect anything close to the evil    unhappy person I wanted to appear as
If I were able to do all those things, I would abuse my already bad name,    and just slip through the cracks
It would be so easy
Just look like a    druggie and just fall out of reality
I wish I knew if anybody would try to help me, but Maybe we are all just    like me
Afraid
If someone I knew was using, I couldn't do anything about it
We all make    some choices that others don't like, and we all wish we didn't when we get    past it
If you feel like just dropping to your feet, then do it
Surrender to the world and get it over with
Take the easy path, and drip    into the sewers like you never existed
Who would notice
This wasn't meant to be a drug speech, but an apology
I feel like I've    done something wrong, and I feel guilty
But to me, it all seems so    distant
Like it never happened
What happened to me, I wonder, that I    never noticed my own wrongs but only noticed the hurt
It feels like a    weight around my body, but I cant get rid of it
And in a way, I'd rather live with the guilt, than live with getting away    with everything
I think I'd rather slip through the gaps of society than    slip through my own guilt like a wet, heavy shirt, threatening to sicken    me
I think that if I take off that guilt, I'll change, and become even worse    than before
So guiltless, that I can't even feel that somehow I just hurt    you
So, apology accepted
I hope not

Pact with Christian 10/9/06 NEEDS MORE SENTENCE STRUCTURE VARIATION     This year is too intense
Not only did everyone start way too early, but    we've done a TON of distance, we're going race pace on distance runs, and    somehow we don't work out enough
Pre-meet today meant Woosamonsa and 2000 cruise miles
He meant two 1000's cruise
Usually    premeet means 20 minutes and then going home
Sometimes if it's an easy    win, 20 minutes and then the two cruise 1000's
Expecting this, we both    wore old trainers with the support of
flipflops
Woosamonsa eh
My first reaction was "I can't do it in these shoes" and    then "oh damn, I'm going to have to run Woosamonsa pre-meet
It comes before everything    else, including my personal well-being
The first thought was to just get    out of doing Woosamonsa
It wouldn't be so hard, just walk up to Zalot and    say "I can't run it in these shoes, can I do something else
I walked up to him to say this, but he had different plans
Before I had a    chance to suggest I skip out, he told us we weren't racing tomorrow
We    were going to do a 18-20 minute cruise during the race (which is still    pretty fast
seeing as I'm going to be pulled to the 18 side), and then    hop into 2-minutes-on, 1-minute-off doing the course a second time
I can almost hear a narrator pulling out the ancient line "the plot    thickens
Lightning flashes
of course
Just then I get the bright idea "why not just change shoes
then you    won't look like a slacker
Just run home, switch    shoes, and keep running
I speed out of the room and get to my locker
I    pull out my key and return
The team usually hangs out for a bit before    getting started, so I walk right up to them and say "bye guys I'm going    home
Matt gets it immediately "Yeah, start now
Why
I guess just because it's embarrassing to have a huge head start and    end up behind
Maybe just the way Christian said it sounded a lot like a    challenge
Before I get out of the building I'm already jogging
As soon as I hit the    first big street, I'm going hard
My form got a little screwed up because    I was holding the keys in my hand
I'm sure I could've just put it in my    pocket, but I'd rather not have them mysteriously jump out somewhere on    Woosamonsa
I'd just tie them into my shoes after I changed
I hit my house in 7 minutes
For some reason, I was sweating like ridiculous
As I tied my good    trainers, I seriously made a huge puddle
I was in awe of how 7 minutes    could cause that much sweating
Just a little note to everyone
Don't put your shoes on, then tie your key    into the shoe, then try to leave your house
You kind of need to lock    your door (well, you don't have to but my mom flips out if I don't so I    do)
And, even though I am freakishly flexible
it's SO SO hard to lock    your door with a key attached to your foot
I practically sprinted down my road, and looked around for signs of where    the team was
I knew for sure they weren't past me
which means that I'd    have to keep my sprint pace for 6 more miles
A little after the mile    marker, I checked the time
12:30
I'd wasted 5 minutes changing shoes
I    could imagine Christian right on my heels
So I did the only thing I could do
I worked my ass off on Woosamonsa
Every 20 seconds or so I would start slowing down and then re-focus
I    even pushed hills
It was a lot easier seeing as this felt like a life or    death race
I never push hills except on races, and even then I'll only go    as fast as I need to
By the time we turned the last corner that signified    it was just three miles left, I was dying
It was so hot, so sunny, and so    fast
I check the time again
If I subtracted my extra 5, I was on a perfect 7    minute pace, and the rest would be downhill except for a few rolling    hills
But I was dead
I tried to keep the pace, but everything hurt
I don't think I've ever really worked that hard
Maybe in track meets    where I can keep focus for the whole race, but never in practice
I did    NOT want to be caught
For about a minute I lost the focus
One of the greatest things about    fall, and the falling leaves, is that when a big gust of wind blows by,    all these leaves shoot into the air and flutter haphazardly to the ground
The shape of the leaves makes them really hard to catch, so I try to    snatch them out of the air
I caught one today
I had to sprint a little    to grab it
Just as I pocketed it, I heard a "thump thump thump" behind    me
I looked back and saw a really exhausted looking Christian
Complete with    bright red shorts, blinding blonde hair, and a pretty funny painface
Swearing loudly, I focused again
it was hard
I had more than two miles    left and I was starting to doubt if I could even finish
Christian caught    me pretty soon
He was throwing in surges
He would stay the same distance    for a little, then I would hear the steps get louder, heavier, and closer    for a bit
and then stay the same distance back
Then he made his    move
and I knew there was no keeping up
My form was awful; I was dead tired
It was freaking hot
Right before the    mile, I heard a more consistant person passing me
I thought it was Matt,    but Dave suddenly appeared and swooshed past me, noticeably slower than    Christian
Everything hurt so much, and those two decided to take a stupid    way
I turned right and made my way to the back gravel road
I was dead tired, and the only thing I could think was "they'd better have    water
After a bit, we assembled and stormed the Freshman Football team's water    supply
It was good
It's what Guy refers to as an "Earned Sensation
If I had to    guess I'd say there's a Smith, a Jones, a Watterson
I don't know
What if    Brian ________ gets injured again
are you just going to let ___________    take Runner of the Year
You'll be sitting on the    sidelines and say `Gee that's a nice medal, can I see it
Wow, first    place, that's really good'"     "Well, that's what I've been doing for the last few years, and it didn't    bother me then
Matt laughed at me for this mentality
Oldfield was either trying to inspire me or cut his losses by asking    whether it bothered me
Christian just laughed
We ran our 1000's
I ran like shit
I gave everything I had into that    Woosamonsa
Plus, I sort of stopped caring when everyone dropped me and my    legs refused to work
Back in the weight room, I was complaining about how impossibly hard    running Woosamonsa was today
Well trying to hold you off was a pain too
That was definitely my    hardest Woosamonsa ever, and I even had to add on a
mile to my house and    a
mile back
Maybe if you worked that hard    all the time you'd be better
I donno exactly, but the outcome was pretty    important
oh yeah, Christian wanted to beat Brian ______ in track
Brian gets injured a lot, but he's still really fast, and Christian gets    closer every year
Or
wait, maybe its because I was saying I'm here for    fun, as opposed to Christian being here to beat everyone
I can do it,    it's easy
Christian wants me to work a lot harder
I have some potential
whats this
EVERYTHING but the two mile
Turkey trot innocence                          By your bestest friend of all
You know the one
Like I said, I have a very active imagination
I didn't explain it very    well, but I was never that clear verbally anyway
The day was like the lyrics to "Dancing Queen
Jamie and I were    sitting with Will and we were talking about some of the random 5k runs    people can join
There's these people in costumes and there's like    1,000 people
hold on
People in
costumes
I get this image    of a huge turkey suit
Waving its arms around wildly, it shakes hands with    a man with a giant Pilgrim head
think guy from "Shrek
She giggled
She was wearing    normal attire for the season, a short-sleeve shirt and, as it was a bit    brisk today, loose fitting sweatpants
She had a number pinned onto her    shirt and was flanked by a swarm of tired young men
She was in the middle    of the fleet, where all the action is from a runner's viewpoint
This was    where everything comes down to a split second, and your mind must be just    as strong, or stronger, than your legs
The men were dressed in T-shirts    and shorts with papers attached for numeric identification
Looking ahead    and preparing to ditch these losers in a powerful surge
she sees the    weirdest thing in her entire life
A wobbly, flopping turkey jounces and    bounces about fifty yards ahead
The huge bouncing rear of the "stuffed"    turkey swished its brightly colored feathers in a gnarish salute to fall    colors
The imaginary Jamie opened her mouth and spoke in sync with the    one beside me: "It really made me feel bad
In my mind they were fighting for    ground
Only 400 yards left
The two dodged this way and that on the final    leg, avoiding the more fatigued runners on this light-speed sprint
Twenty, maybe thirty runners, dropped two places as the duo blazed    forward
Drawing ragged breaths and tired out of her mind, Jamie saw the finish    just ahead as they passed a large pack
There was just her and that stupid    turkey alone in the clearing before the finish line
The turkey pulled    ahead, but she clenched her teeth and pulled aside it
At the last second    the turkey jolted with a final burst of speed Jamie couldn't match
A    light flashed and the sideways photo finish showed a gigantic, absurd    turkey just inches ahead
I laughed and tried to explain
Sometimes, I kind of feel bad for you
I mean seriously, the things you go    through are kind of horrible
Well, for one
I am apparently a very bad listener
I mean, today I went    around after track with you apparently talking to me and I didn't hear a    word
Not only that, but many times before (how could you SERIOUSLY ask me out 3    times without me hearing at all
I've developed a system of falling back    on the last thing I COULD hear, and trying to guess what came afterward
Usually these things only happen in loud busy halls, but after track
whoa
Yeah
so while I'm on that subject, what I was saying before your    ceramics class was that basically, when you were out and about chasing me,    I was basically flirting with whoever looked my way
And during most of    this time, you were basically "the enemy" because if I started flirting    with you
I'd really have no chance to resist, and as soon as I knew it,    we'd be going out again
Now that it's happened, I can't see why I avoided    it so long
Oh wait
maybe it's because of what happened last time
I CANT BELIEVE MEGAN PLAYED WITH ME
Honestly
I thought we were going to be like
workout buddies, not
Boy-Toys
I would've been the biggest cheater in the history of
cheating
Almost like you in soccer
cards
baseball
football
etc
Well yeah, and then today was my sort of "I'm cleaning up
but its hard    to stop myself" because Sarah
yeah
Things happen
Oh and
another HORRIBLE thing that happens to you, is me
I've really burned you like 5 times in this here alone
I    should stop doing that
but you know
its hard to get used to being on    the same side as you again
Oh and
my handwriting is terrible
And so, apparently are my reading    skills
If I'm having a hard time figuring out one or two words in YOUR    handwriting, I might have to start typing everything for you
because    that must be TORTURE
Speaking of torture (if I put in a thesis and cut the slang
this would    be a very well put together essay since everything sort of flows in that    special way
either that or I'll have to bring up all the stuff I have    on my "chain thinking") that workout today was very odd
Besides Megan    playing with me like her Boy Toy (and yes I WILL whine obnoxiously about    this for a very long time) I was running hard the entire time
getting    what I consider pretty ridiculous splits, and wasn't that bad off in the    end
I could have gone and done one more before slowing down, I think
And all this running talk is making me hungry
You should go eat something    too
And guesssssssssssssssssss what
I have a problem
actually several
For one
What do I do during track when I see you
I kind of feel like waving
but sometimes I feel like stopping and complaining
And sometimes I want    you to just stop looking at me because I probably look really gross
And    of course there the times when I treat you like any other friend
and    feel bad-ish about it later
Not a lot bad tho
What do I do
And for two
one of my problems has gone away
and lead itself to    another problem
I found money (lucky $10 of life
YAY
now we need a time and    movie
I was on Wikipedia, and i found myself reading about physicists
Anyway, a few brief things to think about:    A) If i don't send in my engineering application tonight, I'm totally    screwed    B) it turns out i have two or three tests this week, which sucks
C) An Einstein refrigerator is TOTALLY AWESOME
D) Can it be mathematically, scientifically or statistically determined    the "perfect conditions" to make a quarter drop and then land on its    edge
Ok, so the way I see it, the major events duing a coin drop (we are    dropping, not flipping, as the is greater possibility of dropping a coin    in a consistent manner than there is of flipping one consistantly
And, all that would be    necessary is about 100 trials and a slow motion camera (i think)
First thing: Dropping a coin relies on a few things, in order to get it to    land perfectly on its side
Landing on its side can be done in the    following ways
So
Conditions for success: A) a perfectly straight up and down drop, no    movement that is not in line with the coin's edge, and no rotational    momentum
Also, The bounce does not significantly change the tilt or    horizontal velocity (in respect to the line "y" established by the edge of    the coin
The second possibility for a perfect straight up and down landing is that    if, by chance, the angular momentum is such that it negates any other,    undesired motions besides straight up and down
This is likely to happen,    because after the first bounce, the coin is usually spinning much more    than it does on the way down
If the math is done right, the spin of the    coin(which should be adequately described by a probability distribution)    can be predicted, as can bounce height
If bouce height is predicted, then    it's only one step away from telling you exactly much time until the    coin's center of mass is such that it is a center of mass equal in height    to a coin that is pefectly on its edge
If those two things are reasonably    predictable, then it would be easy to bounce a coin onto it's edge
At    least, easy to create an environment where edge-landings are more frequent    than it would be by careful planning and a freakishly steady hand
In    other words, It's really hard to get a perfect first bounce, but its    really easy to have a first bounce that is planned to be imperfect, but at    the end of the event, non-human factors align to make the coin do only one    thing: land on the edge
So the basic idea is this: If bounce height and bounce spin are both    approximately normally distributed given a set of standardized drop    conditions (dropping a coin at a certain orientation at a certain height),    and those bounce heights and spins are a function of the drop conditions,    then it would be possible to determine the PERFECT start conditions that    would lead to the edge-landing probability to go from approximately 0 to a    1/1000 chance or greater
How cool would that be
The major things to keep in mind, i think, are that a few things are    fairly consitent
For one, my hand shakes in all three directions in a    fairly predictable manner, where "predictable" means "adequately, or even    best, described by a probability distribution
Upon release, I will    attempt to line my hand up to whatever the prescribed angle is: and i will    ahve a predicable amount of error, tending to hold my hand "like so"    rather than "like so"
Then, the coin will stick to one or both of the    fingers holding it, giving it a predicable amound of spin as it is    released, and affecting the starting drop height in a predicable manner
When you get all these things, and put them together, you have the    independant variables to a function that has dependent variables of    "return height" and "return spin" and a set direction of motion
So
when these two dependent variables line up just right, the return spin    will perfectly cancel any horizontal motion (align the diameter along the    y axis) at exactly a height of Center of mass of coin being One coin    radius from the ground
I think that the return height is almost perfectly at one coin radius
it would give the object approximately no velocity in the z direction, and    be touching the ground, to allow for some normal force
What i think would be MOST interesting, is whether the most probable drop    conditions would be such that the coin would make 0, 1, 2, 3, infinity    bounces before coming to a stop on its edge
If it were 0 bounces, it    means that people are more powerful than random chance in making this    event occur, something that I think is absolutely not true
But if it's ,    more than one or two, or even an infinite number of bounces being the best    to make this event occour (like, if three were likely, but not as likely    as 4, which is not as likely as 5
to infinity), then that means that    humans stink, and anything we touch is terrible, and that being as far    removed from humans is the best course of action
but the    media would LOVE it)
Also, does conservation of angular moment like things that are spinning    and then stopping on its edge
I assume not
but I'm having a lot of    trouble remembering how it all works
Basically, i thought originally "how cool would it be if i could make the    'impossible' happen with relative frequency
Then, as i thought    about it, it would actually be a friggin sweet math/science thing, that's    pretty damn complicated
And as i thought about it more, it would really    say something about PEOPLE when it's all said and done
If you think about it like an expected value problem, is the individual    contribution from having it land straight with no spin ever greater than    the contribution from having it equalize all forces in other opposing    directions
And what kind of coin would be best
I assume nickel because of the wide    edges and relatively large mass (spins less
i think that would make it    easier
E) Religion scares me
I was at a church and they actually used your    "there's a finite number of connections/whatever in your head, but x is    infinite and therefore un-understandable" sort of thing to show that    anyone who tries to figure out religion in a logical fashion is wrong
The    preacher was brilliant, fascinating, and wrong about a few very bothersome    things: especially cross dressing and the targeting of Christianity by    others
It turns out, those are very poorly understood, and commonly    discussed things
I think I'm finally healing
Current outlook     5/3/09     SO NOT EVEN CLOSE TO FINISHED     One thing that's been bothering me lately, is how do we know that our    current outlook is a correct one
Along with this, is the idea that EVERY possible outcome has at least one    upside, and at least one downside
At the very least, the upside is that    it is worse in every single way, and the smallest downside is that it's    better in every single way (AKA cheap as fuck, or at least a kinda boring    option
Like tarot card reading
I gently put my arms around her, unsure if I was welcome
A gentle,    one-sided hug told me I wasn't
I pulled back, and saw that same, empty    look
The same hollow look; the one that she seemed to reserve special for me
Looking straight past me, she seemed to be saying that I was dirt to her
It's the look that always means "I see you there, but I wish I didn't
I don't understand it
Say something
Use words
At least they did
They gave me fair warning before they pushed me away
Before I was    completely cut off
What did I get from Lexi
The one step from letting me hug her, uncaring,    down to an empty disgust
Nothing said
Just one day deciding that she would no long let me near her
That she one    day she would just stop talking to me, and begin talking through me
Just this hollow look
I'm sorry if you think I'm a creep, but even creeps deserve be given a    warning
Deserve to be told that they should expect to be treated like    they were nothing
Deserve to be told that they'll be greeted with empty    eyes reserved special for them
I never intended to start anything with you
I think you know that
And if you see me looking your way, it's not that I like you or anything
I'm just checking if it's alright for me to be myself again
The eyes I    have for you are looking to see if anything's changed
To see if you're    back to the way you used to be
I laugh at myself for being broken up with Marissa twice
a lot

Battle of souls     In the beginning they were simply 5 children, each had special,    undiscovered gifts
They were friends, of sorts, but each unique and each    with their own philosophy
Their names are as lost as the tales they told,    but the same tales are shown again
Each carried guilt and secret lies
Lies unto themselves and each other
Lies to the world, when the world    wasn't even quite ready for their gifts and powers
One by one they broke    away in search for themselves
Life, to the plains of the East, to find    the source of his own affinitive link to nature
Good to the north to    learn from the extremes, calm commanding
The fiery tempers of Rage sent    him to the south in search of power
In the end, only Neutrality and Void    were left, each promising that not even death could sever their    friendship
It would not come
They traveled alone, sometimes encountering    each other in tense confrontations, each saving the other, each learning    from the other's mistakes, each growing stronger and stronger with every    confrontations
Their travels brought them across the continents and to    the others, not knowing what to expect from life, but life itself
Now    adults, each got a calling from whatever power source was so great that    they could take on any foe and be found victorious
Each so specialized in    their own studies that nothing could stand in their way
Only two heard the    truth
The same place, where they each met each    other
The voice spoke of betrayal, it spoke of darkness, and it spoke of    power and death
It spoke of wild imaginings and invincible force
It spoke of unbelievable    power and the undeniable pleasure of slaughter and brutality
Each man saw that She was Fate, and she held all the keys, and she knew    everything about each one, and each one simply wanted to know themselves
One by one, they gave into her infinite power and each was twisted to    extreme polarity
Good forced into a small body with a big heart and    bursting exuberance
Rage into a demon quick to temper and slow to forget    even the smallest betrayal
Life into a shadowed figure possessing control    over the elements of nature
Void and Neutrality into the purest, rawest    energy, each able to command anything
Within seconds of their newfound    power, they acquired another thing
The knowledge that they were just    tools
That they were just incarnations of the past and that each had no    control over anything
That they would invariably destroy, and be consumed    and recreated in another
An endless cycle stoppable by only one thing-    true perfection
The wars began
Rage used his twisted form to destroy, blinded by his own power
Good    immediately countered, with his own powers to heal
This story is crap so far
4/4/09     You know what I was thinking
If you were a pack-a-day smoker, you're spending an additional 6 dollars a    day than normal to fill your lungs with something that is pretty bad for    you, but does add some sort of enjoyment
You know what else costs about 6 dollars, is pretty bad for you, and adds    some sort of enjoyment (for most people, these are pretty good)
Cheeseburgers
One day, someone should do a study where they have two groups of people,    one which buys and eats a cheeseburger in addition to their regular    things, and the other that buys and smokes one pack of cigarettes every    day, in addition to their regular things
Which group would be more unhealthy
Is cost correlated with danger
Food, smoking, drugs, skydiving, etc
But no, suicide tends to be free, or at least inexpensive
If we were more than friends, would your smile still break my heart
When I see you will I still be overcome with giddiness
Will I still feel the oppressive crush of my shy avoidance
Would I still search your voice for a sweet tone set aside for only me
Would I still think you're beautiful from head to toe, even if you let me    close enough to see every flaw
Would ANYTHING be the same between us, even if we only held hands
I'd never be any good for you
It's like you're perfect
And I'm just me
If we were more than friends,     would your smile still break my heart

After this, There Is No Turning Back
But it beats standing around doing nothing, and there's no way I could    turn back now anyway
Today, November 1st 2009, a Sunday, I am opening the floodgates
Owen tried to convince me earlier
and I guess it's as good of a time as    any
Plus, the longer I hang around this place, the more I realize nobody cares    about anything, pretty much
An issue with Luke is most often resolved by angrily saying "I don't care
Let's just drop it
but when I think about it for    a few more seconds, he can be as wrong as he wants, and I honestly don't    care at all if I just turn around and do whatever I was planning on doing
No joke
Also, soon I am installing Ubuntu, which is a kind of major step in    becoming an irretrievable nerd
and the first line of this seems too cliche, so maybe something    like "beats plan A
Or "too impatient to take the bus
4/23/07     Alright, so I was pretty much out of ideas for a new article, or post, or    whatever
I wish I were less lazy, and had more time to just sit around and try to    write something fun/interesting for u guys
And that isn't horribly retarded (sorry about that
it just hit me one    day, can't help it
Don't worry about it
Tomorrow I'm doing high jump
4/24/07     Scratch that
I'm NOT doing high jump
Gee too bad
Btw, O'Brien has told me that I'm NOT allowed to use him as the person I'm    talking to in the "inverse day squared theorem"     Well, I'm not re-doing it
and I'm not going to delete it from my    personal records
so he's just not going to be published (or
posted
if you want to get all technical)
If you already read it
forget it
What bugs me most is that Oldfield thinks I'm not trying
And apparently I'm not allowed to walk around without shoes on
since the first time I used    spikes in races
I only go around without shoes usually for like 5-10 minutes
and most    of that is sitting around being lazy
Is it ever a problem
NO
What else bothers me is that I can't degauss my computer screen (it's flat    panel
it's basically the coolest    thing ever
and if you use your computer a lot and never degauss it,    film the degauss
because it'll be SO cool
If you've never even HEARD of degaussing
go to urbandictionary
com and    search it
There's the best explanation of it EVER there
complete with a "rate my    degauss" sort of scale thing
hah, ok i guess that didn't work so well     but green
like your eyes i guess
i mean seriously
today at track you should have seen those things, they    were like crazy     i was all "whoa" and stuff
You really know how to grab a man
you should live in NYC
lots of single guys for you
use 'em and lose    'em
that's the way they do it there
or so i hear
awkward hug after school today, btw
Its ok tho
See
this is why whenever i'm bored i think about how life would be    better if i could teleport
it really would be
Think about it
you hear "poof" and suddenly i'm there with my arms    wrapped around you
the next second, i'm gone, and for the rest of the night, you think about    me
and keep wondering if i was ever really there (see
i can still    think
when i need to
well, maybe im just a nerd
but that's ok
Because
FF ADVENT CHILDREN is coming
in our mail
long story, you'll call me such a nerd
sadly
if someone asked if i would rather see you or see that movie
i    would have to ask if I could do both at the same time, and they said "well    you could always see her later
just not until one is done
unless you were mad at me
IN that case, cant go    around risking things
But that's ok
because now you're mad at me
so it would be you
and you'll call me a nerd
esp
if i teleport over there to see you     anyways, the point is that im hungry     also
hugs     and for another thing
ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm     there was one more, but i guess i forgot it
ok
scratch that thing about me being able to thnk when i need to     but that's ok     im coming along nicely with my band story
but i think things would go    better if you were here, so i could just use the outline
instead of    adding all htose other unneccesary words
maybe
but the point is things could be going
and im still hungry     but that's ok     but
its not really, because its distracting     ohhhhhhh guess what, i think i can still do the things i used to be
so that's good     that includes hearing, listening, remembering, story-telling, having    EMOTION (its a problem
sometimes i practically lose my soul), have    dreams, sleep well, ummmm,     and other stuff     ok     well     good night
oh right, in reply to what you sent me
yes to all
very true
all of it     except
even having done swimming most of my life
IM BODY CONSCIENCE    so the whole thing with the pool party was not bad     but
you already heard my story on the
8th grade "pimp dance" hahah     Megan's hair :(     too elaborate           ahhhhhhhhhh     that's what it was     the other thing i was supposesd to remember     well all the day long, i noticed it looked good, your hair i mean
but you have good days and bad days, and if i bothered to say it everytime    your hair was nice, then you would wonder what's going on when i dont
plus I always notice these things in passing
Unless they REALLY stand    out
but anyways
im not good with complements anyway
the point is, it    looked good, and i noticed that, but i wouldn't have guess that it was    cut
it doesn't look shorter
just neater (i guess that's the word for    it
i might need to find a better one
and one of they synonyms for "neat" is TRIM
ahhhhhhhh that was great
anyways           what were your times on Sat     I didn't get mine yet from Hunter     speaking of Hunter, i'm going to tell you a story about today's practice
well, obviously it started with your story
which i can only vaugely    imagine
but you cant show me because you dont know how to do it (and of    course
no OTHER reason right
Do you know what i mean
its the comment i made on the Wrobo run tag
I screwed up tho
see the idea was to say something both funny and negative, and watch her    reaction
But
since I wasn't really ready or anything
I said it in a very    non-funny way, and when i wanted to watch her reaction
i got lost in    those deep blue pools she has for eyes
JK, but i was kind of staring    her down by accident
so if you hear any crap from Kelsey, she's not    wrong
Megan neither     So that didn't work out as planned
i didn't figure out anything, except that i can be a real buzz-kill    sometimes
so
whatever
who know if that matters at all
well, then
i played tag with hunter for the first mile or so
AND
i    kept asking him questions
non-stop
Basically how i run with Anna, i ran with Hunter
except i was getting    tired
then Meg said "JEFF SHUT UP" and i heard Tello's "yeah seriously"     so from then on, i only commented when i felt the need
and after being yelled at like that, and tired, and a little tired of the    game, i didn't feel the need often
We got to washington crossing, but i lead wes the wrong way
onto a    street
THen we turned left
and he found hunter in the woods, so we    jumped a few bushes and twigs and got back on track
THen we did the first    mile of the course
like we were told
and they were all going to head    back
Kita joined us
So then i ask Hunter
PLEAAAAAAAASE
he continues to the    right, and i break off, making a left
I sort of got the feeling they all    thought i was just doing it to get a little break
I went #1 and used the funny liquid/gel stuff that sanitizes ur hands
its cool     and smells nice     well, then i was done
so i started off to them
I get this funny notion in my head "I'm going to catch them
He sticks to the left side, but its a right turn
so i take the shortest    distance to the group
i'm also going at pretty much a 1-mile race pace
so i blow right past    him
We go down some hills, then up some hills
and i'm pushing them all
I'm using EVERYTHING i have to close the massive distance     Then
i see a little wrench
and I REALLY want to pick it up
but    i'm sprinting
and my legs are so tired
and theres the issue of    wieght
it might be a heavy wrench (even though its one of the smallest    wrenches i've ever seen
that was my actual justification process
Sprinting, tired,    heavy
Sounds a lot like i'm thinking about how my legs feel, but it just passes    on to a wrench
strange what a human brain can do
well, anywasy, then theres this massive hill
I think to myself (probably for the millionth time in the last two sprint    miles or so
all these random things just pass through my brain, and i try to go    faster
but my legs are in bad shape
I take the inside of this massive    hill
I also am taking it about 100 times faster than anyone really ever    needs to take a hill
Short, strong, fast strides
After this massive hill (and hunter said that washington crossing was    flat
I have a pushed    tempo
but im not sprinting like i was
After a bit, I notice suddenly    how little we have left
A little over a mile, and we're done
I look at    my watch, telling me i've been out for 40
I think "two miles left at    most
only 15 minutes to catch them
I feel a lot recovered from my bit of JUST running fast
that and Meg and    Wes have broken off
and Kita broke off too
I now have a chain
Kita is what looks vaugely like 100 yards in my mind    (when i compare it on the track it was 70 at most
We hit a gentle downhill, and i clear everything from my mind (and legs)    except that i HAVE to catch him, and catch him now
I have this big problem with going faster when i'm already going    fast
its hard for me
I guess its because when you're running at a race    pace, it feels like a sprint, so a REAL sprint is pretty much a mental    screw-up thing
it gets messy in my head
But this time (maybe its the fact that i took it a bit easy for a while) i    could actually clear my mind (like i kept saying to myself for the last 2+    miles "clear your mind and just catch them
when every time i gained about 10 yards on him
he would start to just    hover in the distance like a mirage, and it was like we were both frozen    in time
and i couldn't reach him
but then, i would start gaining on him
for about 10 yards     I got pissed at this, and about 40 yards back of him, i scream    "KIIIIIIIITA"     he turns around and smiles, I wonder if he's proud of me for catching up
So i get to him and
woot     i slow down to his pace, and watch Wes and Meg dissappear into a turn
I    feel good after a second or two at Hunter's pace
Kita shows up
I wonder how
the little cheater
How come I cant teleport
I feel a lot better now
The pain and fatigue melt away from my legs
but my stomach is starting to feel the effect
Mostly in light of this really great recovery i have going on
AHHHHHHHHHHH, i felt so refreshed
Everything was getting so niced up in    my legs
We get to the track, i hop in the nearest gate and say "I win
We get back to the where the girls meet
I plop down and start to stretch, but my belly is going a bit off
it didn't like me
So i stand up and walk around
remembering Ben's advice to Kevin
Things were still a bit off, but they were good for most of the striders
I told everyone about my belly issues
when i try too hard, My body hates me
My stomach gets in a very    uncomfortable funk
and basically it will hurt and randomly squeeze for    the rest of the night
I get chills too
But only when i try too hard
Sarah shows up, and i launch into the story of Warinanco
You show up and i wave
you looked awkward
You walked around awkward
I    thought you were lost
oh well
Now i know a little bit more
but be proud of me
i pushed like 3 miles to catch up
it was basically what you did to me on Woosamonsa
except Woosamonsa is    cursed for me
I'm really weak, you're really strong, and
I played    tag
ALSO     i was nice and did not force the people to come on a crazy 2 mile sprint
honestly Marissa, you could be a bit nicer the sucky people out there
Be proud of me
yay
One boy, two girl
I'm looking for a Chinese saying that says    basically that it's auspicious to have a boy first then a girl, but is    commonly misunderstood
Jiang caught a fish without a hook
Chris Lin's dad told me this one
I forget which one, and also, what the other one means

Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     hey there
Alright
did you get a place to do community service at
Well, today, I just got back from getting acorns
Stupid APES
BTW, what    the hell are you talking about, full moon
psh
there was no moon    whatsoever
And I couldn't find any and it was so darn dark
I left when    it was sorta light so I didn't even bring a flashlight with me, but then    found the acorns after about 1 hr
I never knew it was so hard
And by    this time it was pretty dark so i decided to take a shortcut thru the    woods, but i got lost and I don't think I've ever been so scared in my    life
There were all these owls and some cat meowing and then it was    like  I thought someone was following me
I missed the turn but thanx to    my good directional skills i eventually got out and I was ready to cry i    was so happy
All I could think of was how it would be so much nicer if    you were there, I had my dog but he's not as good as you
and it was soo    dark and yeah
I'm all pumped right now
And then if you think of all    those horror movies that happen in woods, I almost peed in my pants I was    soo scared
and I really wanted you to be there
safer with you I guess)- kinda gay huh
Hey
YOU sat with Kita instead of me
thanx a lot
I'm still pissed    about that
I really wanted to sit with you b/c the bus ride there was    pretty bad
wow, I thought I was gonna hurl for so long and rubbing    my tummy really doesn't help BTW
I haven't felt that bad since I went    skiing with a friend in 6th grade
Anyway, I'll see ya l8r     love ya always, Maris           +----------------------------------------------------------+    |----------------------------------------------------------|    | Subject: | Re: Sup homie                                 |    |----------+-----------------------------------------------|    | Date:    | 10/7/2006 10:32:06 P

hah that sounds really funny     you almost pee'd and you wanted me to be there to watch it
We had a long discussion about    how he was neither cute nor female, so should get out
and then i was REALLY pissed at him when sasha decided to move back with    noah, and if kita would have just moved i would've sat with sasha    (especially after you gave me that REALLY disapproving look because i    didn't block kita out
but he was being really stubborn
Today, instead of going out and finding a community service place, i had    my parents tell me how stupid it was to try to go to the library on    Saturday afternoon, completely unannouced and try to do some work there    (and i didn't feel like tellling them how stupid they were being
i'm    pretty lazy that way)
So i ate dinner, took a nap, and watched a chick    flick
So yeah, i was missing you too, only in my way (i always did like the    chick flicks over horror
but technically horror is a chick flick too,    because i'd rather not have a guy holding my hand saying "omg this is so    scary")- kinda gay huh
I think i have like
girl cycles
because every year when winter    starts coming, i get all emotional and cant get through "gilmore girls" or    chick flicks without getting a little misty
it's REALLY REALLY sad
i never noticed any of this until i met you
so who knows
maybe its just that every fall, you decide to screw with me
you know what i thought was really funny
Richard/Leif trying to take a picture of us
that was pretty interesting     sorry if having my head there made you feel a little worse with the    stomach and all
You know, me and you, we're a good thing     I think everyone agrees
because everyone sees that i still want to be    with you (who knows what you girls say to each other, everyone says that    to me)     but you know, it doesn't really matter (well, sort of it does
but i'm    not allowed to say that)     anyways, did you go to the dance
or is it the other way around
Btw, "sisterhood of the traveling pants" is a good movie
and it teaches    you how to get all the boys by being a ho, and teaches you how to win a    heart the right way
and teaches you that Amber Tambyln is the greatest, because she actually    has feelings, but doesn't go all bitchy/crying all the time and isnt a    ho
but is still kinda hot
but not with two t's like you     +---------------------------------------------------------+    |---------------------------------------------------------|    | Subject: | helooooooooo                                 |    |----------+----------------------------------------------|    | Date:    | 10/8/2006 3:01:48 P

Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     So, I sorta deleted your message so I don't really remember what you wrote    but I'm writing back
did you get any community service yet
teehee, I'm    doe writing about mine
haha
I just love rubbing it in
I don't get    how you're gonna get all those hours in
10 hrs is like 1 day
Hey,    we've got a meet this week, too bad I'm not running in it
I really hope I    can get back by Brown, if not, I give up, I'll just wait untill Spring,    but Oldfield wants me to do like a "modified" winter track, b/c i said I    didn't want to do it so IDK, maybe I'll do winter
This blows
I finally ge tthe Harvard coach and now he has nothing to    look at b/c I can't run
grrrrrrrr      Anyway, you talk so much about Sasha, you gonna ask her out anytime soon
I've actually got a question
why do you always go for younger girls
other than me
I was just wondering
cus I thought, with your    brothers and all, you'd have a lot of older girls, but I guess older girls    don't really want to go out with younger guys so I don't blame you
Never mind
I'm an idiot
Oh, I remember, you asked me if I went to the dance
I don't believe you    don't trust me
Why don't you asked my brother, he made fubn of me the    entire night b/c I wasn't going in order to do hmwk
Grrrr, I have an SAT class today, and I'm not even close to being done    hmwk, and I'm not even ahead
whawha     Anyway
I'll see ya later     +----------------------------------------------------------+    |----------------------------------------------------------|    | Subject: | Re: helooooooooo                              |    |----------+-----------------------------------------------|    | Date:    | 10/8/2006 10:38:37 P

Eastern Daylight Time |    +----------------------------------------------------------+     You know, its never about age
it's the person
I mean, one of the things i liked most about you is that you were so    incredibly
if i hit a soft spot, just ignore me PLEASE) pure i    guess
you seemed like this infallible person who was just so new to the    world, and you were so eager to see everything, just like me
That's why you should never really take me seriously when i make fun of    your utter lack of algebra/chem/physics skills
nevermind)     either way, i dont GO for anyone but you
and i think we all know how    that's going
oh hey, and you're kind of wrong about that (i just realized)
there was    lisa and blake who are older, kelly, "kristin" and fedor who are my    age
unless you're talking about Birdsey, who owes me a movie
damn    herrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
its only half as bad for your legs as running    is
well, its bad for hips and shoulders
and sometimes ankles/feet but i'm    not sure about knees, so i'm going on "if nobody complains, it never    happened"     so its not bad for knees           i was thinking that maybe i'd be able to list some track meets that i    helped get times for as volunteer     that would be cheating
but who cares
oh and damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn i just realized i swam like an hour straight    one time for service
bastards
anyways, i just found out a little while ago that i have to write an essay    for tomorrow     so
yeah
it'll be pretty crappy, unless i dont really pay any    attention to what i'm doing     then it'll be REALLY crappy (haha, it'll probably be better seeing as i do    my best work when i dont care
what is this world    coming to
i went to beg for a    job
and when that didn't work out, i think is when i called you(not    sure
because now i say "beguls"     its BAY GULLS     not BEG GULLS     grrrrrrrrrrrrrr
i dont think it was you     probably either jamie (czyzewski-imagine how many scrabble points that is    :P), ben, or someone on the swim team
btw, have you given any thought to listening to good music
you really    should
No Doubt is a good band (Gwen Stefani used to be hot
but then she got    married, knocked up, and oldish-but not really
then became a pop-rock    artist
so had her hotness revoked)     unless you're not into that kind of thing     foreign bands are sometimes a lot better too
because they are wierder
i mean
they had the Beatles too, that makes them about 100000000x    better, but other than that, there's ABBA, Ace of Base, and    Lampshade(nobody's heard of Lampshade but me
and foreign people    probably
but they dont sell Lampshade on itunes
so angry
so foreign (go go Bob Marley)     and i donno
spainish stuff Gypsy Kings, the multitudes of Flamenco    people (or is it Flamingo
like the bird), that Jesse Cook fellow (is he    really spainish
i dont know
but he plays guitar like a spainish guy)     or you could go all Mr
Zalot and become a Dead-Head (walkin' down the    road lonely
only song i can name by the Grateful Dead)     or Phish
some people like jam bands
but they seem really boring to    me     or go all techno
boota boot
and who could go on without    even a LITTLE Pink Floyd (doom dodi doot dum dum
the 7-8 baseline    awesomeness of "Money")           Lets not mention anything strange
like "gangsta rap" (who said that
M
Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     Dude, If I don't have enought time to watch TV, why do you think I would    have enoug time to listen to music
I mean, I listen to music in the car at    night when it's too dark to do hmwk in the car but yeah, that's about it
I listened to music a lot more in the summer but summers over, there's    always next summer though     hey, we really have to get to gether this weekend to play my game
dude,    it's soooooooooo cool
I'll finish it by then and some of it'll be in    German but it's so basic even Alex Fedor could get it
haha, JK
hmmmmmm,    who do you think the dubmest person in the school is
in our ghrade,    more soecificaly, (Andrew Glander
olny not
IDK) I'm in the running    though so lets just say that I get it so so will you
wow, that    took a lot out of me
OMG, I'm sp physced
I CAN RUN
I'm so happy, I ran for the    warm-up today
You'd be so proud
You're so nice Jeff, I wish I was more like you
Always comparing myself    to you makes me feel so bad
You're my role model
but seriously,    Things don't really seem to bother you that much, or else you just don't    really show it,  and you're always happy and helpful
haha, I love    you
ohhhhhhhhhhhh, I'm pure
don't worry about explaining, I got what you    mean
Thanx
I could make that into somwthing dirty though
think    long and hard, only you won't really have to thinhk that long and that    hard
ANYWAY
haha, I'm notn that person anymore but I want to    be so you gotta rub off on me (in more than one way)
OKY DOKY
Alright, I gotta gto rewrite my ENTIRE english paper b/c I answered the    question totally wrong
OMG, all tyhat wprk gone down the drain

Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     listening to music
can be done while doing other things
just so you    know
oh hey
i think the dumbest person in the school might be either you or    me
i mean
who does THAT much work
only you
what a dumb waste of time
and then there's me
and i can't even get a dirty joke you made up
Pure
the heck
ok maybe it's toooooo simple for me to get     pure=virgin
the only thing i got out of it was "think LONG and HARD"
Marissa
what do you know of that's LONG and HARD
think LONG and HARD about it
me=role model     that's like me looking up to ben
except ben knows how the world    works
and his only faults are various forms of abuse
if ben had a little more self control, and a lot more will to succeed, he    would be ridiculously NOT ben
but more like Bill Gates
Me, i'm not such a good person
and it turns out that being happy is    different than being positive which is different than being optimisitic
and
people who "laugh it off" like me are kind of at risk to be either    total jackasses (woah, who knew i knew french
french that looks like    english profanities
Either that, or everyone    loves to be around them
btw, unless you're TRYING to hurt me, you shouldn't say things like     <3 Marissa     or     XOXOXOXOXO Marissa     or     "haha, I love you"     or     You know what , you were right afterall, I doi think hugs are better than    kisses

Eastern Daylight Time |    +----------------------------------------------------------+     haha, to put it bluntly, you're
well, I'll give you half credit
Dude,    I'm not that dirty (well, maybe soimetimes after XC) not but seriously,    I'll just forget what you said, yeah, I was
to put it your way
the    virgin thing but not totally, but you put it better so A doubleplus for    you
haha
yeah, don't worry about being confused and all b/c i am too
that makes    2 of us
hey, what a cowinkydink
I guess what I sorta want is a guy who I can call my really really really    really good boy (space) friend, not boyfriend
B/c boyfriend involves    comitment and a lot of stressing (which we already have enough of ths    year) and boy (space) frined is basically the same thing without so much    stressing
Ya know what I mean
This makes perfect sense to me so it    probly should make perfect sence to you
OMG, after school today i wanted to give you the biggest hug ever for    Physics and that was made sorta awkward b/c  a
you moved     and b
Tifany was there     Oh, and music is just a distraction that doesn't fully allow you to    complete your homework to your fullest potential
I like doing homework    well
unless it's some dumb art thing which I can BS in like 5 min b/c    we've done them since kindergarten
Wait, I dodn't get that whole French thing
but no, you really are a    role model
just take the darn compliment
siesh
but mostly the part    that everyone loves to be around them b/c it seems true, everyone loves    the be arond you
You have soooo many friends
Be my boy-friend

Eastern Daylight Time |    +----------------------------------------------------------+     before i get started on saying anything important
i just want to let    you know the irony of the subject
because of the misspelling
making it seem as if you truly are
a little confused
you should bring that up during AP english (Stupid NJ made me stop saying    Language Arts)     Wait, I dodn't get that whole French thing
heyyyyyyyyyyyy     i know french     there's oui, means yes     and
je tem (dont know how to spell it
or    boys     (basically i've been a pretty grouchy person in my language recently, and    when it comes out
i feel kind of bad for saying it, so this time i    decided to claim my profanity as being french
well for one
boy-space-friend is here defined as
a commitment
except
i don't really see how that would be right seeing as when i was    with you, you definitely came before generally everything else
for two
i never really got stressed as a boyfriend
that's pretty wierd
for two, imagine if the world worked this way
wouldn't that be    great
Less wars, more hugs
Jamie Czyzewski was such a freaking doubter,    and got super stressed about how she thought she was going to dump Noah
so i told her that and she said basically "you're a dumbass, and you're    not helping
why would you ever be stressed when you had a    boyfriend, unless for some odd reason you weren't allowed to hug me
maybe    it's me
or is currently being lazy, i'm really really    emotional for no reason, Fedor turned me down, you
cause problems in my    life all the time-probably because you're like the one thing i actually    really cared about
in study hall today, i listened to the entire class (every grade    level knew this person) gossip about some guy who sort of runs around as    if every girl he knew was tight with him, and it was OK for him to give    them hugs and touch them and stuff
but the gossipers all hate him for    it
well, i kind of
am that guy
and that makes me feel pretty bad
this may be one time where hugging will not make it better
because    hugging is the problem
i wanna watch a chick flick
that way i wont feel sad about myself
i'll feel sad about some imaginary character
i need a hug     +-----------------------------------------------------------+    |-----------------------------------------------------------|    | Subject: | ooops                                          |    |----------+------------------------------------------------|    | Date:    | 10/10/2006 10:51:14 P

Eastern Daylight Time |    +-----------------------------------------------------------+     Awwww, you're starting to sound like me, so I'll try to sound like you
Hugging solves everything BTW
I wanted to give you a hug before the    race if you could tell, but it was sorta awkward
I have big troubles with    thinking things and actually doing them
and sometimes I think i do them    when I only thought about them for so long it seems like I did it
That    made NO sense whatsoever- I'm doing a pretty good job at being you
teehee     Don't worry about Alex
For one that makes my day b/c you're still    single
and them technically, I'm still "with you" so I'm all happy
But that probly won't last long b/c here's some good news for you
Alex will tell her parents who will tell her that she was asked out and    them she'll go
ohhhh, yeah
unless you were taking it a step    further
BTW, what did you say
Anyway, she's never gone out with    anybody, at least nobody above 5th grade or so, so she's kinda like you    when you met me
I guess
I still don't believe you wouldn't hold my    hand at the Grudge
comon, it's a scary movie, what better time could you    ask for
did you take my idea for the Grudge 2     Hey, did you ever think that if we were in college I probly wouldn't have    broken up with you b/c nobody woulda been telling me how stupid I am and    how you're not the one for me
but you know what, I'm not stupid
Now    I am, but not before
IDK, maybe I'll take your approach and not have a boyfriend for a year
that seemed to work for you pretty well, b/c now you have girls swooning    all over you
Oh yeah, and if it doesn't work with Alex, you could always go for Sasha    who you seem to have told the whole team about
I'm  really sorry about    that though, I guess I wasn't really thinking when I was saying all those    things b/c well, you got all these girls in your life and I'm not really    one of them
I'm such an idiot, you can    just forget everything I said
Oh, I got a favor to ask, can you help me find a way to tell Eric nicely    that I'm not interested b/c I don't want to be mean or anything but he    keeps flirting with me and it's getting pretty annoying (i'm like dreading    every week when he might ask me out)- don't say anything lie in his face    about this though OK
You Best Friend "FOREVER and Ever (you'll be in my heart") Maris alright    that was really gay
darn My Best Friends Wedding, maybe you should    watch that as your chick flick
teehee     just remember, "put a smile on, everybody come on
put a smile on"- wow,    I'm sensing a lot of optimism here

Observations:     flirting with other people is "ok"-dubious     it DEFINITELY looks like I'm a cheater     she lets me slide like grease, but she
doesn't get away with much     she seems to kind of hate me     she doesn't hug back as hard, but asks for hugs almost as much as I do     I probably don't seem like the most "loving" person     I kind of ignore her     Hypothesis:     By doing less with others, and focusing more on her, it will fix about    half these things, but ruin my life     I don't have that kind of time either
Solution:     Get less hugs/less flirting with others, to make her better BY comparison     Experiment
Calling
I have to work     Hugs
I'll do my best
I DON'T HAVE the time to take care of everything     Nobody does though, so its not much a big problem
But isn't that the wrong way of thinking
Its impossible, so don't even    try     Theres just so much to think through, too much that's just opinions
But think of it this way
If its all opinion, then nobody's wrong
So even though nobody's right, the only direction to go is forward
Nothings stopping you, not even the impossible
Theres no end on this map, just a place where you think is the end
Things just flow and ebb like the tides, bringing people along on strings    of fate
Riding on the lines in no particular direction, always going forward even    when backtracking
The only problem is theres only so much string     One string has to be stretched to see the whole world     That would explain why people grow the way they do
At first, all the    string is just big mess of yarn, or a mess of chemicals in the spider    waiting to grow out
Then it mixes and combines to form a strong cord of    life that just easily flows
Soon, theres no more, but that doesn't matter
It just stretches
and    stretches and stretches
Sure, it hurts a whole lot, but what else is    there to do
Sit there and rot
But then, you go too far, and just go too thin
Slowly, you go too far,    until finally, you break
PUT RANGED PEOPLE in the BACK row
THINK ABOUT IT
When a character has long range, melee attacks will do    less damage to them in the back row, but they'll be doing full damage
Also, the CPU does not appear (use of APPEAR is because I haven't noticed    a CPU bias, and don't have any facts to back me up on this) to target    people in the back row less
In other words, you're taking less damage,    with ABSOLUTELY no downside
Why not do it
The counter arguments are as follows:     1
he'll take less damage, and last EVEN    LONGER"
QED
Apparently not
You started just restating your argument
let me restate your argument as what I hear:     "I'll let him get needlessly hurt, because I can
Barret getting hit is not based off his position in front or back row
Putting him in the front row won't make him your "tank" - he will not    attract people attacking him
The only thing you can do to make him "take    it" is to give him cover materia
The ONLY change that back-rowing has is    the amount of melee damage he gives and takes is reduced
So
if using a    ranged character, the ONLY change is the amount of melee damage taken
Taking less damage is a good thing
there is no downside

I've played this more times than you, you don't know what you're    talking about
I use this when the people criticizing me are actually    wrong, or the reason it's done MY way isn't immediately clear
For    example, the people on my Cross country team know me for chewing up and    spitting out this freshman that was singing praises for our coach
I told    him to shut the fuck up because he's a freshman and doesn't know shit
The    people on my team hadn't heard me curse before
Was I justified
Yes
Because I know that despite the fact that everyone on the team knows he's    a cool guy, and a great coach (in terms of motivation, and getting us    better), everyone but the freshmen know that he routinely plays favorites    to the extreme, and makes the girls team cry
He's a huge dick when he    finds it efficient
Is this evil
Absolutely
Do a lot of people do it
I    know I sure as hell do
The next day, he made two more girls cry
After I knew the freshman was    aware of the whole story, I stopped criticizing him when he thought the    coach was the coolest guy ever
He's making an informed decision, one    that's opinion based, rather than fact based
Go right ahead
This is not an opinion based decision
This is fact
And I know FOR A FACT    that you will take less damage and give full damage
So, even though    you've done this more times, you've been doing it wrong the whole time
More importantly, you haven't learned a thing about the game mechanics
You have no clue what you're talking about
Do you have any logical reason    to believe your way is better
No
I have facts on my side
3
if people have been using bows and arrows for ages, and some asshole    comes in with guns and says "its better this way"
you're honestly going    to stick with bows JUST because "it's the way it's always been done" There    are a lot of instances where the status quo is established BECAUSE it's    the most efficient
This is not one of them
You're sticking to an    inefficient method for pride
For something that's so easy to change, and    is visibly better, why not
Because you've been doing it wrong for the    past 9 times you've beaten the game, and don't want to admit it
OTHER INFORMATION:     Why do you THINK they gave you a "long range" materia
BECAUSE LONG RANGE    IS BETTER
Extra defense versus melee attacks, and no downsides, except    for a wasted materia slot
POSSIBLE DOWNSIDES     Because I have flaws too
Back attacks: Barret will be in the front row, and everyone else will be    in the back
How often does this happen
One in 50
Even less
Honestly, who cares about that 1 in 50, when this method is much more    effective for the other 49
Melee weapons:     Barret will sometimes have a purchasable melee weapon that is temporarily    stronger than the strongest available ranged one
Go ahead and buy it, and shove him up in the front row
It's only like 2    points that this will happen
As for me, I decided to skip over it, and    keep him ranged
The game's easy enough that either way is fine
HOWEVER, at the end of the game, Barret's weapons are ranged
So
put    him in the back row
Also: Prediction of responses     "Jeff, you're just being a dick, and you don't know what I'm talking    about"     Maybe it's a dick move
but I do know what I'm talking about, because I    pay attention
I haven't seen any decreased rate effectiveness from front    row to back row for RANGED damage and magic, but there's a very obvious    decrease in melee attack damage
There are no other differences
So
the choice is very clear
I know what I'm talking about
Now to address the dick part
ITS SO FRUSTRATING watching you play WRONG
Yes, the game is easy enough to get away with pretty much anything
I know    I beat the game with no lvl 4 limit breaks, but I couldn't get any of the    Weapons until I did
I beat the game without Knights of the Rounds, but    didn't get kill the some of the Weapons until I did
I beat the game with    only Cloud's ultimate weapon, and one mystle (or whatever the name of that    armor is)
The game is plenty easy
But
this is a simple 3 or 4 button change that    immediately provides a very noticeable difference in effectiveness
And    your arguments are essentially "I've done this longer than you, so I know    what I'm talking about" and "He's more effective in the front row (He can    take more damage than others)"
Just because you've done it longer, doesn't mean you're doing it the most    efficient way
VERY OBVIOUS EXAMPLES: happened the same night I told you about    back-rowing long range characters
1
Rufus and poison: It works
Its mad easy
I try it on all humanoid    bosses
and I remember with 100% certainty that Rufus can get poisoned
So poison him first, and then kill the dog
2
Rufus had barrier on (because of the dog) and you kept attacking him,    dealing about 27 dmg
Humans are usually weak to ice, and even if he    wasn't
YOU DON'T ATTACK PEOPLE with barrier on
why the hell would    you do that
Any magic attack would deal more
The ONLY possible reason is    because you were too lazy to hit "down o, o" to use magic, and just felt    like holding down x for the rest of the battle
Pain in the ass to watch    that
3
Putting bolt on Barret, when he has natural long range
If you only    have two Bolt materia, you should put him as attacking all the time, and    the others as casting bolt all the time
This will maximize the damage    output, rather than one guy casting "ice" all the time

while    being me    Jeffrey63090 [8:20 P
M
She's    this little stickfigury type person  and she parks her bike in our    school's bike rack
and SPRINTS over to where the team is
everyone    just watches her run by
and silently thinks "freak" in unison  (when    you're a mind reader, and you get that massive wave of the same thought    it's pretty funny  but i wouldnt know
of course
so
really just like me and marissa all mixed up    Hybridshiek [8:23 P

never growing up)    Jeffrey63090 [8:24 P
M
its kind of this general consensus
Anyways, The most recent chapter of the Jen Pfaff story starts on one    strange saturday when Clare says "you and Jeff should hook up" (or maybe    it was "hang out")
anyway, Jen says LOUD AND CLEAR: "NO THANKS"  and i'm    like "ouch
that hurts"    She just brushes it off saying "sorry, no offense" (which i say ALL the    time when this sort of thing happens)   and everyone makes fun of me for    the rest of the day    Hybridshiek [8:26 P

and REALLY REALLY sarcastic
Jeffrey63090 [8:28 P

i wore
umm
what i wore today    and passed by her agian and she just  shouts out "NICE PANTS jeff
I'm    really loving it"  i sort of halfway ignore her
because i was pretty    tired today  and a tired jeff looks a lot like super-emo jeff but thats a    whole nother story    Hybridshiek [8:29 P

Jeffrey63090 [8:29 P

nah    Jeffrey63090 [8:29 P

but i forget what it was
and then (here's the    climax  get on the edge of your seat)    Jeffrey63090 [8:30 P
M
There were    people on the sides of the trail  SCREAMING with pain and CLUTCHING thier    legs and CRYING and everything
so thats what i remember when i think of    my first holmdel race: everyone around me in immense insane agony
and    they werent able to finish
Then Jen comes along  and i have to tell it    over again for her  because she seemed so excited to hear it, but when I    finish, she's like "ok
M
She didn't, so she went on
i'm    right here, and i'm not deaf
right

maybe not"    Jeffrey63090 [8:34 P

CHEST
November 14th 2007     After playing football in the New Gym, and settling some business with    coaches gifts, Kita, Richard and I are heading out through the 300 hall    intersection, and Rich begins a story
Instead of everyone emptying immediately, it usually    takes a full minute for the last few to get up to leave
I stayed silent, waiting for him to go on
He expected a response, so there was a short pause before he said,     "Well, anyway, I was waiting for Wagner to get ready, and I was sort of    staring out into space
and then, I'm going to not say anything else until we're outside    because there's people here
it was cloudy) and Wagner    was out on the prowl for some ladies
Rich gives me this look that tells me I'm wayyyy off
The door closes behind us, and he starts up again
well, I was just spacing out
I didn't even mean to
but when    Amanda Kemble was walking past, I sort of just stared at her boobs the    whole time she was walking past me
I hope she didn't notice"     For a second, I was thinking about telling Kita "SEE
Everyone thinks    Amanda's hot
This sort of thing happens all the time to him
and he    just wanted to get it off his CHEST
Apparently, when he spaces out, his eyes just    home in on Amanda's boobs
I bet he's glad he could get this off his    CHEST
She would consume my soul, and I would consider it a good death
Rip my heart out     Rutgers is not like swimming at all
Owen also has flashbacks, which are also inconvenient and painful
We were both young when I first saw you     Four- miles Davis     Blue monk-thelonious     Straight not chaser- thelonius     Charlie parker     Look into the sky
He reads out loud to himself when he studies
My girlfriend used to do    that
Then we broke up
Now my ex-girlfriend does it
I'll have to remember not to screw with Vincent too much about him    thinking I'm a pedo (although, at this point, isn't it him KNOWING that    I'm a pedo
While talking to Vincent: (about Elise
THEN It's kinda sketch
I forgot about that one
Hmmm, well, You'll just have to    remind me to break up with her before then
Ok
Sasha has chosen her side
Sunday, May 31, 2009     I guess that's all there is to it
She's very different from who I remembered that she was
Cold and confident
Sorry about all the talk about Cornell and things
Internal friction within my mind has set me ablaze,     And Sasha's mind runs smoothly
It never grinds against itself
And It's oiled with the indifference to feelings that she's developed
And cooled by her icy damn heart
Internal friction     My mind has been set ablaze     Moral issues suck
Cold, hard callous words     Sasha: un-a-tain-a-ble     She's so different     At least this shows me
That although I'll feel sorry afterward, I seem to    be incapable of stopping myself
And, at least now I'm familiar with the Sasha that has become
She could    manipulate anyone
well, i'm screwed
before i actually start, i think i'll give a bit of    background on me, Atwal and the mysterious C
S
Atwal is a boy living on    my street and going to my school and in my grade
very strange
oh and    he has the most important student council position next year-treasurer
we're loosing lots of money, so the Treasurer should be a freaking genius    next year, but alas, we're doomed now
CS is Christine Sca-n-- with random letters dashed out 1) because i forget    how to spell it, and 2) because she has absolutely no idea that she's on    my website (in several places actually)
once i tried to tell her, but    that was after the incident about to be described, so she was more than a    little PO'ed and ripped up the original copy of one of the entries
I used    to like her, but she's not my type, i
e
ditsy blonde albeit charming
moving on
Started 6/9/04 Finished 7/30/04     Well, well
I'm in some trouble with Goldman eh
well, she'll see how i    deal with people i
e
www
geocities
com/mikepersak/pink     heheheh     I SEND THEM TO AN INTERNET DOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
ahem, moving on
It all begins with me and Atwal
One day it seems we are doing an    obnoxiously boring review with everybody misbehaving
Mostly it was not    me, as I was on the brink of snoozing off in the back
Soon thereafter,    and unfortunate chain of events lead up to my second referral to the    office
After quieting the crowd of unruly, and wide awake, students, Mrs
Goldman becomes fed up with the group
Apparently my right hand is disobedient to both Mrs
Goldman as well as myself, as it was the first to rocket into the air
Seeing as Atwal was closer, she refers to him first
Quieting my voice to an almost in audible    murmur, I continue with one of those great comebacks that always go    unused
After possibly three minutes of mind-numbing boredom and whining to each    other, we bring a new form of entertainment to the world
It wasn't    exactly smart, or new at all
In fact, every person who has asked me about    this event called me a retard, or at least stupid
Here's how it all went down
My TI     Never leave home without it
I lost my programming virginity to my TI-83 Plus
I remember opening it freshman year and thinking to myself    "This thing is really heavy
And as I gazed upon The Manual I felt as though I would never understand    more than the most basic commands
Hell, it didn't even have an = sign
However, as the years progressed, I learned of the secret ways and    numerous shortcuts of this valuable tool
Under the study of Matt Cook, my    knowledge of the calculator grew exponentially
Soon, I was navigating the hidden back menus and using graphing shortcuts    to gain an advantage over many peers
But despite the power and knowledge I had already acquired, I was greedy    for more
I wanted all that this machine had to offer
By the end of freshman year, I had experienced my first session of    calculator-to-calculator intercourse
The feeling was powerful
addicting
My first hookup was innocent enough, I took a quadratic    equation solver from another
But it wasn't enough to satisfy me for long
Soon, I hungered for the dark power of these connections
The first time,    I had no idea how to do it, but after a few minutes in the back of the    class together, an older student showed me how it was done
By sophomore year, I had been given Mirage OS
With the application, my    calculator boundaries were widened
Ignoring the words of my teachers, I    freely engaged in calculator gaming and swapped programs with numerous    partners
During Sophomore year, I received a new tutor in calculator commands
Mr
Shrager, a seeming God of the TI
Soon, in addition to its gaming and math class uses, the sciences began to    demand the tool for manipulation of the dark ways of Chemistry
As a well experienced calculator user, I entered a number of constants    into the Alpha Values
Avogadro's number, and the R of PerVNeRT were the    most commonly used, saving me a great deal of time and frustration
The    trend continued into physics, and I rarely ever had to enter any universal    constants
But the greatest use of this tool was in the dark society of the BC CALC
One day, the class was summoned to try to find the most powerful tools    imaginable for the calculator
After brief experimentation with small    programs such as AREA, we discovered what seemed to be the holy grail of    all Applications
It was as if God came down from heaven and claimed "YOU    SHALL SUFFER NO LONGER
Newton's method, RAM, Simpson's Rule, Trapezoidal Rule, Euler's    Method, Area between 2 curves, Rotational Volume/Surface Area, even Arc    Length
All commanded by a single omnipotent application
Plan B
9/22/09     Ok, let me start by saying this:     The reason Blake hates me so much is because back in high school, I would    always fuck with her, saying that I was madly in love with her, and I was    dying to go to prom with her, and how she was my favorite person, etc
After seeing her for the first time this semester, she asked me "oh yeah,    were you ever serious
Did you seriously like me
It was a terrible idea on her part, because it might have taken me a few    weeks to remember that I love to tell her how much I love her, but this    sort of jump started it
So, clearly, that sort of thing doesn't work well for her
And yet, I am considering it as a really fun alternative to dating Tessa
Probably, she'll just disappear
Jerkface
According to Luke, "go for it" for all situations: one likes the other,    the other likes the one, and neither likes each other
But that's probably because I phrased it poorly
If you throw the phrase    "fucking with" around too much, it gives the listener the impression that    although you are seriously considering this act, it is not a serious    decision to make
Normal social rules apply, even when they are not taken    seriously by the committer of crimes
It's really rather unfortunate
And possibly, that's what I've been doing to Sarah
Asshole didn't call me back
But anyway, apparently I'm not Tessa's type
Doesn't mean she doesn't like    me, but my response of "that's too bad
because you're my type
Bye
I would LOVE to continue our trend of her giving me crazy emotions on the    inside, and me flirting with the line of "I have just now directly stated    that I like you"
I think it's much more fun to just be like "damn, it's    pretty clear to every single person that I'm so into you, but I'm never    going to say anything directly
because I'm having way too much fun    being an asshole
Definitely yes
Normally I'd say "FOR SCIENCE", but in    this case, I already know the outcome, and am doing nothing to prevent it
In fact, I'm doing this retarded idea knowing full well that it sucks ass
Maybe my luck will change
Maybe I can get her to play games
I like    games
Hopefully I can get us to go crazy
Or at least me
Being insane    may be happy
Ha ha
Good one
ah, the drama
nothing quite seems to rip people apart like it
more    savage than a grizzly bear with rabies
scarier than having a cute    little dog suddenly bite you without warning
and more self destructive    than jumping out of a really high building with slit wrists, falling into    a deep ocean, connected to a lead weight with a waterproof gun pointed at    your head AFTER taking tons of unneccessary meds
oooooooooooooh     thats silpooky
silly, and yet spooky     that didnt work     never mind
I guess my whole laugh it off "stress releif" tactic doesnt seem to quite    work
for one thing
not exactly fun     and another
did it ever REALLY work
and another
people make fun of how happy i am
but sometimes i wonder    where they get it from
i'm not THAT giggly
am i
AND ONE MORE thing
it makes me look sad when im not happy
like a    depressed fool
im not very equipped to handle the real world i dont think
i always    feel like i cant do anything without sacrificing something
i always feel like im losing one for another
like i traded ALL my free    time to x-country and WAY too many honors courses
and by losing my free time, i lost one of my best ways to vent all that    stuff that just sits in my mind- all my writing sucks now     at least i think so
it might be just that now im exposed to the    writings of my peers, and not just random things
like now i see Maddie's writing's and the sheer emotion that flows from it     and everyone else just has SO much detail into the world, that its all    just oppressive on my mind
the only one NORMAL is lisa, but i bet if she acutally cared she could    pump out some amazing stuff- like all those poems     EJ's a REALLY good poet too, i dont like writing poetry, its not fitting    to the way i think- not very "fun" way of expressing things
There are some people in life where you think of them having a birthday    and think "Hmmm
No, this is a much different sort of thing
It's the "Hmmm" of realizing that the person already has everything they    need, and the means to easily get everything they want
The English language needs some to establish some social norms for me
And    for everyone else
I wonder if other languages have something for this
But in a polite way
When chatting on AIM, or Texting, or having    an email correspondence, or even something like passing notes, or writing    letters, there's really not a really graceful way to say "ok, this    conversation is totally over"
It even applies to phone calls
One of the most important things to understand about what I mean, is that    this is a person who you initiated conversation with, someone that you    enjoy talking to, and someone who you hope to see in the near future
Also, someone who you can generally talk about ANYTHING with: even    useless, not extremely interesting crap
ALSO, and probably most    importantly, you don't have anything better to do in the near future:    you're not a terribly busy person, but you feel somewhat guilty about    wasting time with them on AIM or txting, or whatever
In short, it's a phrase that can be used when a conversation becomes a    nuisance, but is probably not boring you, or becoming awkward
The current standard for this sort of thing is "I gotta go" or g2g for    short
Other things are synonymous, in that they show a need to leave for    some reason or another, when the truth is that the conversation is just    OVER
Friends of mine have suggested that on AIM, in particular, an effective    method is to drop a g2g, then block the other user, so that it seems as if    you have actually left
Whenever I use g2g, I actually log off, and go somewhere else, at least    briefly, so that I don't feel as guilty as if I straight up lied
There are two major problems with this method
First, and foremost, is    that it's just a huge lie
As a result, I categorize as this as "a dick    move"
If someone caught you doing this, they would obviously be insulted,    but not too hurt, seeing as everyone does it at some time or another
It    seems to me, that a seemingly creative, but temporary, solution has    somehow become the norm
For me, this is generally unacceptable, though of    course I have been guilty of it many times in the past
Universal "I understand that you're blowing me off, and I'm cool with it"

Cartoony idea     This sort of thing happens all the time in comics
And
never in my    life
It makes me sad
Two friends are walking along
One has a small cut on his hand (think    "papercut" size)
The other is a girl, and it's obvious that even though    they aren't together, they should be and want to
Where
as if to make    sure they're still there
The tale for that wound is a story of heroics    and chivalry
He    thrusts his chest out and struts for a bit
and almost instantly deflates him
However, he reads her expression and continues along with the tale of    "heroics"     "It was a dark night, last night to be exact
The rain seemed to drowsily    wage war on the earth, and all was covered in a wet blackness
The only    sound was that of the rain dropping from the sky
but the rest    was said distantly
A dramatic decrescendo accompanied his story-telling
His eyes seemed to look far away, and he crouched down slightly, as if    preparing himself for what was to come
Rather unpleasant things
I
am one of them
he continues on
I could hear the ambush a mile away
Slinking from side to side, he brings his hands to    his belt, as if clutching the hilt of a sword
They launch out from all    directions, attacking in perfect unison
I only have a split second to    react, but then again, I only need a split second
He looks    like a hero, and for a second it seems like he's glowing in a rich    light
why weren't you on the bus this morning
did you    get ready in time
I CHOSE not to catch the bus and walk to school
for practice
I knew you were dumb, but I didn't think you were    mentally retarded
In the darkness they    clash together
Only one hits it's mark
Suddenly, one ninja has fallen,    and 5 blades remain
As I slash again, the ninja leap into the air, out of    sword range
He looks to the sky and looks about to leap    into the sky after his "ninjas"     "Flying ninja
This story sucks
Not just flying ninja
FLYING VAMPIRE NINJAS
They start turning    into bats and swarm around me
The bloodsucking parasites are everywhere,    and dodge every one of my desperate slashes
He spins and swings his arms in pantomime, trying to    defend himself
and I think it's all over
I    know I have only ONE Chance to be saved
I never even saw it coming, but    there was no time to worry about that
falling slowly
He seems to have dropped his sword, and his facial    features show the incredible fear and desperation of the situation
ONLY ONE CHANCE
He continues to fall
slowly
he's completely horizontal now
balancing precariously on his one leg
what really happened
Hurt yourself being stupid
I couldn't open a package of applesauce
would you mind
Let's go
well, I can't say you don' try, anymore
Ya know, when we met, you were a pretty confident guy- you always had    something smart or funny and sarcastic to say
You pushed my buttons in a    good way
I loved being with you
At first dating you was great but after    about 3 months it started to change
The first thing I noticed was how you    stopped making your own decisions- everything was left up to me, which was    weird
It was like you had lost your personality over night
Seriously,    everytime I asked you which movie you wanted to see or what you wanted to    do over the weekend or just if you wanted to do something at my house,    you'd shrug your shoulders and say you didn't care
Then when I'd make the    decision you'd start sulking as if it wasn't what you wanted
It really    got on my nerves because there wasn't anything I could do about it
There's no way  for me to know what you were thinking unless you had told    me- I'm not a mind reader despite all you may think
Maybe you just don't    like the things I like (swimming- I mean come on, I'm not gonna watch you    sit while I swim, I can do that better myself but you're on swim team so    why wouldn't you like swimming, I don't care if you're body conscious-    it's how you are so deal with it, there are people a whole lot worse off
The next thing I knew, I started getting tons of phone calls from you
It    was like you didn't have anything else to do so you'd just check up on me
I have a life other than you though
And ya know, I trusted you with other    girls, it was your choice to hang out with them
But you didn't trust me    with other guys
I gave you space when you hung out with other girls but    you were there 24/7 when I was with another guy
I think that's why I    started dating Cael, just to show you that this was my choice, NOT YOURS
You never seemed to respect my rights to have a life
I like having guy    friends
I have to say that all through elementary school those were the    majority of my friends b/c they generally like doing the same things I do
You know I'm not a girly girl
I hope that someday you find the girl of your dreams because I know that    deep down, you're still that guy I met Freshman year
I know oneday you'll    be a great boyfriend to some girl if you just learn to chill
It's just    too late for that girl to be me
Your friend forever, Marissa
I dreamt the world ended
It was a very long dream
When I awoke, I was disappointed to see the ground
I dream the world ended
Life continued on in pretty much the same way, only I was happier
I only remember that I once walked from a couch, across the empty,    groundless space, to the next room over
Nothing surrounded but debris,    and endless stars in all directions
Things were in every way the same, just without a floor
And we were happy there
But eventually, gravity twisted and spun around, and I found myself    looking at the sheets around me, and the rugs to my side
Gravity slowly adjusted around me, and I gradually understood that the    ground was there, exactly as it always had been
And I was disappointed
And then I was sad
Why was I so saddened to see that the Earth still    stood
I need to understand
And I remember thinking
From all the    people
A place that is eternally my own
And there is no place where    there is no gravity
And there is no place where the stars and silence    utterly surround you
No place I know of yet
Plus, I just had a break

Beliefs
Donno when this was written
It was hand done, and I remembered it    recently, so I had to come back to it
It was definitely during senior    year of high school, because that's when I had AP Stats
Background: we were supposed to have a sub
Either that, or it was just    going to be a lecture before Shrager got there
I guess the most important    people to note in my stats class are Bianca:Sasha's friend, Emily, Jen    Jin, Ross Holly, Jordan Rowan
Walk into stats tomorrow
Hugs and holding hands are good Ponder on this grammar      2
Magic is real      3
Something is somehow terribly wrong
The entire whole of all society is    based off beliefs
It's
totally mind boggling to try to imagine    someone with no beliefs
needs further research     But really, mostly we want our beliefs to become reality
That's why a lot    of religions are focused on people that can transform their beliefs into    reality
People with beliefs so strong that they bend the facts to meet    their fictions
Believe me, if I could, I would fly around all the time
Really, I would
But I can't do that
There's a lot of things I can't do
Like, for one, behave kind of in any    way like a normal person around you
But what I can do -> and I've only learned this one through practice
is    that I can completely suppress all my emotions around you and try not to    let anything out
And, that's not a good thing
And I'm sorry
But until I can learn to do the rest
This is the only part that I    believe I can do
So
um     I'm sorry for acting so weird all the time, and for shunning you    Sometimes
Please don't let that reflect on my feelings (*feelings is crossed out)    for you
and stuff
Zombies     In the morning of 4/19/09, Eric, Erik, Me, Kristen, Luke, Spiros, Avi, Dan    Malzone, and Erik's visitor (Barbara) all played zombies: where the zombie    is blindfolded and seeks out the other players and grabs one
Afterward, we talked of things
I told them the story about how there is a    natural number X that cannot ever be thought of by humans
Most of them    didn't like it, but it did spark a very captivating discussion
More importantly, we talked about the fortune teller at the Spring    Festival today
When I talked to her, I started off with a story about a    rock, which I found and had originally thought to be magical
At first,    she responded with skepticism
After a bit, she realized that I was not    joking, and we began to analyze each other
It was an incredible battle
Me looking into her eyes, and seeing the same sorts of things that go on    in mine, but have been suppressed, rather than amplified
We both caught    on rather quickly, but continued to play mind games with each other
I    told her what I know, and she told me what she told me, and neither of us    was really positive of exactly what was going on (or, so I've been led to    believe
Dan Malzone and Spiros told the story: that I had approached her with the    story about a rock, and she thought I was fucking with her, but then as    she came to the realization that I was serious, and seriously interested,    opened up to my subsequent question of "How did you get into this    business
I am unsure why
Perhaps because it is simply    inappropriate to ask these things
Maybe because they also thought I was    fucking with her
Maybe because it is simply an uncommon event
To EriC, who was laughing the hardest, I asked what was so funny about    that
But it was very simple
An interest from a young age, then reading, and    exploration, and finally a random path which lead her to the current    profession (which does not pay well, only hinted at by her suggestion to    stay in school)
And that is what I had predicted
And that is what she lead me to believe,    though there is always room for the possibility that she was toying with    me based on what she believed to be true
In other words, she's better    than me at what we do, and could easily manipulate me
Not only that, but most people continue to believe that it's a scam
More    unfortunate, and the MOST important item of the night, I think, is that    most people think that Every tarot reader knows that they are scamming    people
This is what angered me, and what I argued on
To understand why this angered me, a few basic things must first be    understood
For one, When I spoke with her, it was quickly understood    between both of us that I was only a few steps away from being her
A    difference of lives, actually, but the important thing is that I saw some    things that were very familiar in her
A whole method of seeing the world    that co-incided with mine
Her path is one of many that I consider to be    equally likely of an outcome as my current state
This I summarized as: If you saw things like I do, then you would know
The second, (actually more like an extension of the first), is that I had    a lot of interest in this when I was younger, and still hold to the basic    ideas of Tarot reading
Tarot card readings work on the simple assumption that: If our lives are    run by unseen forces, then seemingly random events have reasoning behind    them, and nothing is random
Based on this hypothesis, if you happen to draw these five cards, then    these five cards are the ONLY five cards you could have possibly drawn on    this round, and that if you can understand them, you can tell which of an    infinite number of paths the person is on
Or at least, present a general    area, of which the individual can only hold a small fraction of the area
More simply put, Tarot reading is the art of applying the meanings of    cards to an individual's life
Almost "any Tarot book will tell you this in the first sentence" (what I    said to Erik)
The third, is that they were being extremely ignorant and short sighted
My logic was the following
Say, when Tarot readers were first invented,    they were actually a bogus magic that spawned from scam artists
And, as    they put it, only retards would believe it (which is insulting me,    therefore my view is extremely biased)
But what they fail to realize, is    that after the first generation of Tarot card readers, a fraction of the    retards who are scammed learn the trade, and practice it as true    believers
Even only after the first generation of Tarot readers, there    are practicing true believers, and I THINK, but have no evidence for, that    every subsequent generation has a similar number of scammers as the one    before it, but has many more true believers than the previous generation
And in the modern day, when most Tarot books openly admit the basic    assumption of Tarot: that random data had meaning, then true believers are    even easier to come by
However, it is highly improbable, but impossible to disprove, that there    is a secret society of actual magicians, that are aided by the common    society believing that it's all either bogus or the logical result of a    possibly faulty assumption
As I said to them: there is only one logical outcome to their beliefs, and    that is that practicing true believers exist
But then two arguments quickly shut me up:     (I think Dan Malzone had this one) First of all, their primary function is    as entertainment
It is essentially a moot point on whether they're true    believers or not, because the service is the same
But viewers don't care
They're paying to get fooled,    and are happy to do so
The second, from Erik, was REALLY good
Even if they are true believers, then they're still knowingly scamming    you
Because the payment for their services are much higher than they need    to be
Especially true for the true believers, who would probably equate    their job to matching up the cards with proscribed meanings, and taking    educated guesses to how that could apply to the person specifically
During the course of this discussion, I was extremely angry
Barbara was    intently listening
She may also have seen a future self in all of this
I almost stormed out
At the end, when Erik delivered his final blow, I sat stunned, in silence
And throughout, was the argument that I have too much free time
The ignorance of this REALLY got to me
The topic was called unimportant,    random, meaningless, etc
But was it really
As I said to Dan, his belief that all of the Tarot    readers were scam artists was stepping on literally thousands of people's    professions, and according to my logic, stepping on many true believers
And what's worse is something I've noticed for a long time:     People tend to not think things through as much as they should (yes,    including me)
The logical outcome of "tarot readers are scammers, the only people who    believe them are retards" is "within one generation, practicing true    believers exist"
And for me, this was the next logical step, taking about 20 seconds at one    point in my life

Stole my idea
E-po-na     Ep-on-a     I think I'm getting increasingly extremely confused
A lot of times    recently, Things don't get synced right
I see mouths moving    inconsistently with the sound I receive
Things jump about crazily
I'm a    lot spacier
I'm very confused
Can you Actually curve bullets
Does the knowledge that you WERE dreaming change the fact that you didn't    know you were dreaming when you were dreaming
Because it does for me,    with only limited success
Dreams for me are malleable
Because they are fictional, and never    happened, you can change what you know how it happens
Hm
I should continue being good at English and math
It seems important
If the dream world were an entirely separate world, and we are independent    people in there, then would our dreams be hallucinations
Hallucinations are the dreams of their world
A child is born with pure blue eyes, and slowly darken to the appropriate    color
The demon's child swirled with fury, and changed to pitch black within    minutes of birth
At 2:30 AM on Monday morning, December 1st 2007, I went to bed after    talking to Eric and Luke
Shortly after, I had my eyes closed and was    drifting off, though they were still watching videos online on Luke's    computer
Something very strange then happened
I have deduced that I must have been    dreaming, but it was quite vivid
In a continuous blur, I watched from my    bed as Eric smoked weed in our room
He got really high, and Luke began to    also be high, though I'm sure he never smoked
I also got high, but I    mysteriously did not smoke either
I felt it in my lungs, and in my head,    though my arms and legs didn't do the normal high things that I've    experienced so far
After a long, confused time being high, I announced that I had to go to    class at 9 in the morning, and things settled down
I remember that I was    really wondering how I would ever be able to wake up that early, and    saying that smoking that night was a bad decision
I checked my watch before I went to bed, and it said 5:35
The next morning, I woke up on time, and when I woke up, it was as if I    had been high the previous night
I was still wobbly, and for the next    while, everything was shaky, unsteady, and distant
Until around noon,    things continued to be shaky
On my way to the student center, I remember    taking a big step that didn't exactly land right
But, I still felt like there was no way that I could have possibly gotten    high that night
And Luke certainly wouldn't have
ever
So I decided to    ask him and Eric separately, and find out what they said happened
Though    I was pretty sure they were lying for the first half of their stories, I    suppose it must be true
I went into bed, they were watching a few more    movies, and then left
As far as anyone knew, nothing happened between the    time I went into bed and 5:35 AM
An extremely vivid dream with long term effects

f=2&t=4393&p=13672&hilit=subtitle+wrap#p13672     if (rendered-sub-width > screen-width) {    breakline();    }     I wonder if people that Only like rap/hip hop like guitar hero
Because, when you think about it, the target audience of guitar hero is    nerdy people or casual people that like to play video games, but don't    know how to play guitar, and definitely aren't going to be rock stars
Those people are also not extremely likely to like rap/hip hop
Also, a lot of rap/hip hop is listened to by poor-er people
So, although    they will often have a console, they probably won't be getting guitar hero    1,2,3, etc
and so on
Most because it's much more than average price    (factor in the price of guitars, drum kits, and other things
and although it is often a individual thing
that individual    thing is mostly practice for hanging out with friends while playing it
and playing it well
And not failing
But
Do rap/hip hop people not tend to play guitar hero
And also, the original question is "ONLY" who ONLY listens to     Magic and women
Most women are magical
When I say this it immediately gets the idea that they are magical because    of all the things that make them awesome
For example: "do you believe in    magic, in a young girl's kiss"
And the way they move, and the way they    look, and the way they act, etc
But
I didn't mean that in this case
According to www
not-included
net, the spirit world is just another    dimension where matter is influenced by thought as well as physics
And    the result of that is called magic in my book
So
Why do I say that    women are magical
Because of exactly that
Most girls I've ever watched eat have very    interesting discontinuities
Fat girls only get little salads
And    though most people think to themselves "who are you kidding
A lot of thin people    eat a freaking ton
Especially thin girls
They often are physically    capable of eating an entire batch of brownies, then polish off their    dinners
So
why can they physically consume that much, an absurd volume of food,    not to mention the caloric consequences, and still remain as thin as ever
Because of magic
A girl can consume an entire batch of brownies because her mind desires    those brownies
The matter that enters her body in brownie form is under    the effect of not only normal physics, specifically digestion, but is    influenced by thought as well
As a result of her girl magic, she will be    able to consume tasty brownies indefinitely, and remain thin, until she    finds that she should have been gaining weight
Then, she'll get fat as    hell
When I was young, Time passed in hours
A day was twenty four long    segments
As I got older, and school picked up, things moved in blocks of about 3-4    hours
Swim practice, two/three halves of school, time for work
The day    was a series of a few large chunks
At around high school, time moved in days
Each time I awoke was a new    period of time, and if I didn't sleep, then clearly the day had only been    extended
When I woke from a nap, I found time to be unreasonably    disoriented
And now, in college, the weeks seem to fly by
I just thought of how it    must seem to people back home
I've been gone for ages by their    standards
and the memory of them is still so fresh
What am I to them    by now
A remnant
But to me they're still flesh and blood
And when I get older, what will the basic unit of time be
What's a month    to me when I'm 25
A year, when I have 40
What's a decade to an aged man
And some day, when we've learned to stop time
What does 100 years matter    to the eternal
Youth
how strange
12/30/08     I wonder: does the "gotham knight" bullet deflection type thing work
Also: if you were to drop a large object from a predetermined height onto    an oscillating spring that is breakable, what are the conditions for    breaking
Specific question root: if you drop a bowling ball onto the ground, which    is oscillating up and down, I bet the time it would be least likely to    break though the ground if the object impacted with the ground when the    "spring" was in the displacement = 0 state, but has upward velocity
But
to break through, would the best collision point be the same    position, but going down
Or maybe, depending on the object's mass and    the K of the spring, the object would get more done if it fell the extra    Delta-x, and hit the spring at the very bottom, just before the upswing    started (where v=0, but A and -Delta-x are at a max
That would be interesting
I forget all my    SHO and Spring equations
Also: when discussing religion, I discovered I have insufficient    information
For example: evolution ignorance
I bought evolution hook, line, and    sinker
Someone told me "if you look at fossil records, micro-evolution,    Darwin's finches, populations that are on the verge of speciation,    homologous structures, then you will see that Evolution is a pretty valid    theory
Doesn't mean it's the only possible explanation, and doesn't mean    it MUST be right, but it's as right as we can get about now
does it
And one of the core things about it is:    We're special
We don't see other species converting naturally occurring    things into "technology"
Well, I thought that evolution couldn't be PROVEN to exist, but then I    thought about dogs
IF there are solid records of dogs being bred out of    wolves, and IF dogs are no longer able to have fertile, viable offspring    with wolves, then we have created a species
And also, every single person    who says evolution does not exist is plain wrong
Intelligent design is    still in the running though
and not believe in evolution
But, my family tells me I should    just "let sleeping dogs lie"
I saw a political clip of    someone saying that Christianty is under attack in our government, and    then John Stewart says something like "Oh ok
it's like we've had every    single president OPENLY CHRISTIAN
But other things are a bit less easy to disprove
Specifically, I don't have enough facts and data to prove that Christians    are MORE under attack than others
For example, Sudan
I feel like    Christians who say that their missionaries, aid orgs, etc
are getting    attacked are TOTALLY right
but are completely ignoring the fact that    they're sticking they're hand into a fire and complaining that they're    getting burned
If you're trying to help people that are in the middle of    a killing-type thing, expect to get attacked
Also, I would like to do a    statistical test on whether they are getting attacked disproportionately
Example: percentage of attacks on Christian orgs, considering the    percentage of Christian orgs to total orgs
Or
considering the lack of    Christian orgs with guns
And also, I always felt like Christians complaining is wrong because they    feel like they're being attacked MORE than other religious groups
For a    while, my automatic rebuttal was "what about Muslims
so when someone says    "yeah, what about them
Plus, a lot of people like to throw out    "Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world" (although I attribute    that to a slow population growth in the Christian parts of the world, and    a high one in the non-christian parts
I bet that if you really compare    things, Christianity is growing slower than a LOT of religions, but I    DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO PROVE THIS)
My other counterarguement was "didn't chrisitans start it
That's all true, but HOW true
I donno
So maybe I should stop that
But then, I remembered:     Christians aren't under attack
Jews are
Quit yer whining
You didn't have a Holocaust

date=2005-04-07     3/10/09     In the future, everyone will have a single sized cup for every drink and    circumstance
Also, it may or may not be foldable
So, if you were a time traveler, you should be surprised at the idea of    having different sizes of drinking cups
You laugh at the quaintness and    inefficiency of having to choose which size or shape or texture of cup you    would like to drink from, on a day to day basis
You claim that there MUST    be a single, most optimized cup size and shape, that is statistically    proven to be best for nearly all fluids and occasions
You will also completely disregard any claims by present-dayers that there    is in any way a lack of individuality and personal preference within this    mindset
There is, by    definition, a finite set of critical points over the function that    compares the size and shape of cups to the utility, assuming that cups    larger than ourselves will continue to have deceasing average utility
It    just so happens that there is a single absolute maxima, which exists for    all people of my approximate size
So, I suppose, we are both right,    because the size of cup IS dependant on my specifications
Great
Just what I've always wanted
Bring on the steady syrup flow    of irrelevant infobytes
I say: in the future, we will have a homogenized society
Not because of an evil government, or a severe reaction to immoral    excesses,     but because everyone wants to copy the people who are making a lot of    money, and its a lot harder to be original     3/17/09     I finally put at least some words to that feeling, though they are very    false, and not a very good description
It was a facebook status message,    so it doesn't have to be
Jeffrey DeLucca floats up, and glides along (or is it "away", as I    originally remembered
I'll check back later) slowly
But from that brief second, I    generally am all over all at once
However, I still like this image
Because, Although I am gliding along    slowly, Is it because it is difficult to glide
Or because I am so very    tired and lazy
Because gliding is a very simple thing, like walking, that    doesn't warrant more attention than to absently float off
Or because it    is a more dramatic image to glide off slowly
Perhaps because gliding    slowly reflects the surreal nature of a motionless glide through space
3/17/09     In ANCIENT:     Spring
They say it breathes new life into all of creation
Flowers bloom,    Birds chirp, the world is green and young again
Or is it
Something about all of this has always bothered me
In the    winter, the trees lose their leaves and go into deep hibernation, and in    the spring again, they come back into full bloom
And People say that    spring brings new life
Isn't it just that the trees are one year older
One more year closer to    death
And aren't they scarred and damaged from the forced retreat from the    elements
Doesn't it make sense that they would fear the coming of the spring, for    they know it is only a brief rest before the winter comes to take its toll    once more
People should open their eyes to the world, and see it objectively
They    too should fear the spring
They should hate this false hope
I bet I could make it DARKER if I tried
Also,    make the logic more apparent, or at least present :P )     Old blood
Youth isn't all it seems, I think
Isn't it common knowledge    that you have your father's blood
And your mothers blood, and the clones    of your mother's mitochondria
And, your father also has his father's    blood, and his mothers blood, and his mothers mitchondria
And the same    for your mother, and the same for your grandparents and great    grandparents, and your great great grandparents onto infinity
Everyone knows this, but they say that you have young blood in you
No, you should say
I have the oldest blood of all
You are lucky to be    older, and closer to death, for you are more pure than I, and your father    more than you, and your grandfather before you even more so
I have the oldest blood of all, and I carry your sins on my shoulders, and    you call it a blessing
My only blessing is that each of my fellow man is    equally cursed, and it is my promise by blood to carry your sins to the    grave, so that we may all one day have peace
Murderers: Many of those who were treated with (THE SERUM IN ANCIENT)    became murderers
What most people don't realize is that we weren't    deranged madmen
It's not that way at all
When we're granted eternal    life, and a sudden clarity, it's the rest of you that seem insane
Chose    to live in hell if you wish, there is nothing to stop you
But if I find    it pleases me, I will do you a favor, and lift your curse
Don't speak to    me about the value of life, I see it plainly
Open your clouded eyes, and    you'll find that life is as precious as the dirt beneath your feet
I    would gladly trod upon it, use it as it was intended, and protect it, if    it were mine, but it is no greater a natural phenomenon than any other of    the multitudes you see around you
We didn't suddenly gain the desire to take life
Far from it
We have    simply discovered the true value of it, and in its worthlessness, we lost    any care for protecting it
3/17/09     Suicide
Where is the point at which one's life is so useless that death    is better
I think if any of us thought we knew the answer to that    question, we wouldn't be around to answer it
Also, do you really think    any of us could fully understand what it means to KNOW death is better
I'm sure that we're designed not to grasp that understanding, for it is    not very useful in Darwinian terms
Gods only destroy
As the whole world lifted it's voice in unison to God,    praying for Him to save us, He finally answered
And it was then that we understood that the power of the Gods is not to    create, but to destroy
Our God simply removed any other possibility but human life, and we were    born
Creation is only the byproduct of the destruction of every other    possibility
3/19/09     When you think about it, some things that are totally normal, are    definately not
The best example is when you refer to people of all types who are aged    20-60
They're just "normal people"
And older than that are "old people"     and even older than that are "really old people"
and younger are "teenagers"     and younger than that are "kids"     and then even younger are "babies"
pretty standard stuff
But, if you think too long on that, it seems pretty weird
For example, for the people younger than normal people
that's thinking backwards from the perspective of normal people
but for old people     that's thinking forward from the perspective or normal people
So, why are they making the rules on these things
the people in the    middle
When you're a kid, you think of everyone else as kids, instead of them    being normal, and just every     (needs to be much more persuasive)     (I'll finish this later, it's partially what me and Vincent were talking    about with Butterflies being the standard, and Caterpillars being named    for the butterfly they will eventually be
It's also about how I see so    many things from both perspectives now, for example, I see that things    such as trespassing, and yoinking random things from people are bad and    illegal, but I also see them from the point of view of a runner who wants    to run a field innocently, and someone bored, and wants to find something    to do that will be eventually returned
It's possible that we are corrupted, and    simply think ourselves to have been newly enlightened
And, if all this, then what about old people
April 1, 2009 April Fools day (I think this is the right date, but it was    around this time at the very least
However, I was    having trouble articulating what I meant, and he didn't believe me
So,    later on, I came back to the room high
I grabbed out my whiteboard, and drew a quick diagram of the HUD, and    specifically, the magic meter
The thing is, that though it takes a full    MP BAR to use thunder or heal, it only takes a blue block to regenerate    the first MP bar, and at high levels, that's essentially one hit that you    take, or a couple of hits that you give
So, if you're low on mana, your    mana regenerates extremely quickly, and if you're at high mana, you can    spam fire or blizzard infinitely, because each full bar carries its equal    number of blue bars
Basically, you have infinite mana
So, I explained most of this to him (this is much more detailed, but the    basic idea was conveyed) and he said "Is that what you do what you're    high
Endlessly analyze things
In    his eyes, I became detail obsessed when high, and focused on PROVING him    wrong
This was particularly insulting, because I take note of, and prove    things like this when I'm sober MORE often
In this case, I    was totally correct
Dreaming
Shifted things quite far
Impressive
The ghosts    merged, counted off and then became a female figure
Should probably not    try to imitate Rorshack
Can't Spell
I wonder if this sort of thing would destroy your mind
4/8/09     Luke wears his mind on his sleeves
And there is often only one word to    describe being able to see the entirety of one's emotions: Ugly
To be able to see every ounce of someone's happiness, confusion, anger,    etc
is simply an ugly thing
To even see the effort to hide it, and the    typical pallet (which type of palette is the one I mean
Captivating as well
I think that our continued proximity will only become    more informative, useful, and interesting
A continued experiment
No, more like a further study, and another set    of data on what it would be like to live my life as an open book
I think I may have shown Ammaar further into my mind, by my choice of    music, and my comment that it is very interesting to see the opposing side    of a very tired person
When someone just wakes up, and they are supposed    to have been working, they often try to jump right back into things, but    often are simply inadequately prepared for the task
And it is very    visible
And interesting
I equated it to watching a small child, who    refuses to accept his own fatigue, but that didn't go over so well with    him
I'm also pretty sure that Luke knows I'm writing about him
And that nobody likes my music except for me
One more thing: I should take a philosophy class
I'm very interested in    what Instrumentality is, and other basic philosophical ideas
Personality    theories, etc
I feel as though I understand Luke a little better, now that I have these    words
Although, the cost is that he knows me a bit better, and has gained    much more understanding towards me
Expect that he will like you less
4/12/09     Finally copying the things that were on my whiteboard into a more    permanent form
It was a pain in the ass when I wanted to logic out minesweeper, but    couldn't do it in my head
Also so I can study for my calc test
Luke has defined himself in the terms that he learned in Communications
He is an Androgynous Plus
What this means is that he is "Instrumental"- a    collection of traits that are typically male: Arrogant, controlling,    leading, goal oriented, etc
But also is "Expressive"- he shows emotions very strongly, and his mind is    run by them
This is spawned from when he came back from being with Aria, and was    FANTASTICALLY happy
She wrote something on his hand, with which he was    utterly obsessed
I commented (I am continually surprised by his intense    emotionality, how apparent he can make his emotions
One of the reasons I stink a lot of things is that I    tend to care very little
I care very little, which is why I cannot focus
One day, I should get people, including myself, to make a list of all the    things I should care about, but don't
I also drew a picture with a brain, saying: "I feel as though my mind is    changing
Perhaps even changing my body along with it
Where this heads,    we do not know
We shall see
I still do
But it is true
My mind is changing, and it certainly is taking my body    along with it
In the most literal sense, I practically gain 5 pounds    every time I smoke: when my mind alters, so does my mind
But further than that
I am seeing the world differently, and it is    beginning to show, I think
I was talking with Michelle (and Sunny) one night, about what I had    thought about Luke (which is now less true, now that he has defined    himself to some extent)
I saw a collection of traits that seemed to    coincide somewhat with mine, but the longer I knew him, the more    irrational his entire existence seemed to be
There was no underlying    logic to him, and the longer I knew him, the more it seemed as if he was a    slave to circumstance
Things in his life seemed to insert themselves into    his list of personality traits, forcibly, and were accepted as fact    without having to be true to his central logic
In other words, though for    most people the "sheet of paper" that defines why the list can exist has    priority, Luke's life is such that random things are stapled on,    overwriting what would normally exist, and using a logic that does not    necessarily have to be his own
Luke is a more complicated collage, and so    defies any reasoning
Do we all become like this eventually
It seems that    as life progresses, things that simply SHOULD NOT BE, eventually ARE, and    must be accepted
If reality breaks with the underlying logic of a single    person's mind, there are only two options
Either the collage is built, or    the mind breaks, and refuses to accept reality
How many foreign logics are layered upon mine
I wish I could see it
4/12/09 (but at like 1AM, so therefore 4/13/09)     When I was walking back from Kevin's place (where I dropped off the car,    keys and cough drops- this was the weekend I saw Dragonball Evolution with    Spiros, hung out with his cousins for a while, and had some Cluck U
also, Avi's sister was here overnight
What is the meaning and implications of the word "hard", in the context of    "difficult"
When something is hard, that means that the speaker finds it    to be taxing or requiring of skill
But
that definition is definitely    lacking in a few things
For one, when I played Heavenly Sword on "Hell", I could be said to have    had a hard time with Whiptail
But that's because her combo takes out an    absurd amount of damage, and if you screw up on one block, you get boned
But does this necessarily mean it's hard
It's more like it's something    relatively simple, but the cost of screwing up is high
And what's more,    is that with an appropriate change in tactics that is equally Bullshit,    the process becomes simply a matter of repetitively causing small, safe    amounts of damage, taking forever, but is very "easy" as long as you don't    screw up
So I guess, this is more adequately described as tricky
But because there    is a trick to it, then it requires a skill, and therefore is hard
Hmmmm
Also, hard is a personally subjective term
What is hard for one person is    not necessarily hard for another
Does this mean that for each use of the    term hard, there is a clarifying statement that is either implied or    stated
I guess so
And taxing
Running is taxing, but not hard to do
Requires much work to    do well, and I generally say that running IS hard when I'm out of shape
This is strange
I suppose this is one of the things that is very easily understood, but    difficult to formally explain
Another word like this is "good"
If I say something like "If you've ever    eaten good chocolate, you would really like it
If they consider Hershey's to be better tasting and feeling than    Lindt, then they would say that Hershey's is good, while Lindt is not
That is the definition
But I prefer finer chocolates, I think (though I require more detailed    analysis-hehehehe, but seriously do)
So, if I say "this object is good",    then it means I have a liking for it, and especially in regard to personal    tastes, it matters very little what others think, or would classify as    "good"
So, what is the nature of the word good
Lindt chocolate is said to be    better, but if I honestly preferred Hershey's, then what
Especially in    the case where I adore Hershey's and abhor Lindt
Any time I describe something as "good", it automatically should be    considered a theoretical falsehood
If these are good curtains, or books, or whatever, then it means that my    mind is biased by personal opinion, and my deductions suspect to fallacy
The world is complicated by our views and observations
That is all
4/23/09     I'LL PWN YOU LIKE A SHAKESPEAREAN SONNET abab, cdcd, efef, GG
4/26/09     This is what was written on my whiteboard:     I love to criticize my own ideas with unfair bias
OR DO I     And about OWEN     "either that, or this music enhances those activities naturally"     4/27/09     (originally, I just said "infinity is truly powerful    imagine if you were infinity
you'd be a fucking baller
stuff    approaches me
Wtf a dick
you'd be a fucking baller
All like: stuff approaches me
all the time
n approaches infinity for infinite sums, (sometimes i)     Hey, a lowercase n has sweet curves
but then you look at the little nub, and you're like
umm
she-male
not cool
and t approaches inf
for a lot of stuff
and a lot of things approach infinity, so it's like if a bunch of girls    (variables) came up to you all day, and Approached you
5/2/09     I'm repeatedly reminded that I don't actually see things that differently    than other people
but why do I love post-rock so much, and not a single    other person does
5/2/09     Someday soon, I'll be able to play all day and night, with no care as to    the repercussions of my actions
But until then, I have to feel guilty    about it right before bed
The things written on my whiteboard from then are:     Awkward demi-gods
To this, I said that    this would mean war
Because I thought I was the God of awkward
Yes,    although, now that I think about it, we have both made each other feel    awkward
I suppose this means that we are neither the god of awkwardness
Rather, we are demi-gods
And I suppose, rather than fighting, we are    simply co-existing, and occasionally create our element in the other
This is because I failed at meeting people at the party
Although my    tendencies with friends seem to be almost abusive of the reduced personal    boundaries, when I first meet people, I hate to even talk to them
Everything is strange
This was also because when I get involved with girls
it's a very slow    escalation
From talking, to hugging, to playing with hands, to hugging    more, to holding hands
And then, hopefully more, but not often, exactly
I feel as though talking to the people I knew from high school will be an    abridged version of when I first met them
Because (so far, in my    experience) I get the sense that we are strangers that recognize the    bodies of each other
and only after a day or two will we once again    recognize the being within
Or not, depending on how much everyone has changed
5/10/09     at like 2 am
Visited Owen at around 12, talked with him and his cousins (have chat logs    from Gmail), and then went to Hanna's
Went for a walk
She's not used to    any of this sort of thing
But remember "Everything is horrible, all the    time" and "Everyone is fine with everything, always
I wrote "I wish I could get the world to think"     STRONG UNDERCURRENTS of Hanna
Especially the fear of being an arrogant/cocky person
Especially in respect to the fact that I have thought about my own mental    dispositions a lot (too much)
Thoughts drift back to her a lot
Please stop
If she fails the test because of me, I'll feel really bad
If I fail because of her, I'll blame myself
Things would be pretty simple    if I could do that

i wish
does sasha like me
its so hard to tell
at least we're buddies
i feel so awkward around her
its this thing you cute girls do
just    make me feel really weird on the inside and i want to be around you, but i    dont want to get too close
You know what's weird about trying to go out with girls
There's this weird place
ok    im not explaining this very well     imagine
how much someone likes you is a big chart
and at the bottom    they hate you, and at the top is them worshiping you like a god
well, the chart isnt just flat
it has little peaks and folds, and there's    different zones
like at the bottom would be enemies, then aquintances,    then friends, then it like splits in half to best friend or boyfriend,    then at the top, it's GOD
the thing is, right at aquaintances is the highest peak of all
Right at    the second you meet someone, you're almost always going to fall from that    peak to friendship or they'll kind of hate you
Only rarely do people make    absolutely no judgement on someone else, but considering how many    thousands of people there are in the world, there are a lot of people you    just don't care about, and they have their own little hole in the    aquaintance zone
then, its downhill into enemy, but there's a STEEP incline to get to the    "i'll kill this person first chance i get" zone, and then there's a    shallow hole for people you want to kill
they just sort of simmer there    usually, but they can jump out and become jsut an enemy if they try hard,    or you give it time
On the other hand, going into friendsville is like going to a nice open    field
there's a lot of space, its always sunny, but there's a few little    ditches where a friend or two can just sort of disappear and you forget    about them for a while
he really liked me, but i sort of ignored him
and felt    really bad about it a lot of the time
but it's cool now)     but
if you're trying to jump into bf/ or bestfriend zone
there's a    huge cliff
what is that
i say people should be able to freely mingle on the friendzone and bf    zone
life would be a lot better
So say i'm trying to climb my way up into being your bf
either you're    going to have to lower a rope and just let me in
or i have a rather    nasty climb ahead of me
and you're at the top throwing rocks down at    me
Where i was going with this
i dont really know
but it probably had something to do with how i'm not allowed to hold    people's hands (fedor's a jerk
steph just thinks im wierd
or she    knows that i'm REALLY screwed up when i'm not with you and will deal with    me like people deal with old people
you know what i mean
btw, i should re-teach myself how to read palms
i used to know what the    lines meant and how to read them
Sasha has a halfway decent fate line
i only knew the fate line because    i dont have one
and
for some reason all her lines are all light
and her hands are    pretty damn sexy
just like i'm not into steph, i just get bored and want to do stuff with    my hands     oh and
Marissa's quote: Anyway, she's never gone out with anybody, at least    nobody above 5th grade or so, so she's kinda like you when you met me
I    guess
we had a
ummm     interesting discussion during lunch involving this sort of thing (Fedor's    intelligence level and sexual experience)     and
now my lunch table think's i'm a horrible person     but that's ok, because it lead to the GREATEST thing of all time said by    Kelly
i mean
she was so shy when i met her, and she    still was during our spainish class together, until she got put into the    corner with me and Cole
Ok Cole had a MASSIVE DISGUSTING crush on her, and he would always turn    around and get his mack on and try to seduce her through baseball (both of    them were huge yankee's fans)
He would be all unsmooth too
it was    painful to watch
i mean, even I can keep my cool around kelly, she's not one of the cutest    on the block (a lot of fun though, i'd be lying if i said i wasn't kindof    into her)     well anyways, he would be SO uncool with her, that i'd have to step in and    show him up, so i was always taking Kelly's attention completely away from    Cole (she was SO glad about this
i mean, i'm serious eye candy hahaha    jk) and me and kelly made so many private jokes, grew VERY intimate and    then i sort of lost interest because Cole always screwed me up when i had    kelly all into me by calling out "jeff you're a faggot who talks to much"    to which i always silently thought "wow cole, coming from you
yeah,    ok
well anyways, she was mostly clean but i slowly dirtified her with all my    "cole-sex jokes"     she really enjoyed it because A) cole is an ass B) cole HAS an ass- a big    one
C) she was so into me, and laughed at basically everything i said    D) he was right there in front of us while I constantly made fun of him
so
earlier this year, when my lunch table was finding out that even    though we weren't together, i still really liked you, we somehow got into    a line of questioning involving how i used to swim at your pool
did you LIKE swimming at her pool" Tommy asks
then COMPLETELY out of the blue, Kelly (who is generally silent until i    bother her) shouts out "NAKED
then we BURST OUT LAUGHING     i mean
it was Kelly, the CLEANEST person at our table
the QUIETEST    person
and she burst out completely randomly with this
to eat dinner)     That kelly is a dirty one
first with "naked"
but she gets a lot worse     (when i went over and hung out with her, her mom developed a pretty low    opinion of me
but that's ok
because i discovered that sadly, she    doenst have anything "fun" in terms of
sexual
at her house
my relationship    with Fedor
and i was explaining how Alex is kind of
ummmm     well, this is really awful
so
i guess i'll just say it in the most    exaggeratedly awful way, so you'll think it's just the way i put it
and    not that i'm a really awful guy
Well, Fedor is both really not the brightest or the most experienced
so    i was thinking of just using her for my own pleasure
And I don't    mean just screwing around with her like i do with you a lot (seeing if i    can get you to hold my hand even though we're not together, or mooching    hugs, and trying to get you jealous, or pulling a "Miss Congeniality," and    seeing what happens when i do weird things
I mean seriously just    going in
doing whatever I feel like and sort of shrugging it off
that makes me feel like an awful person
so i probably won't push her    very far
i would feel bad
so then my lunch table reacts in the normal human way "JEFF OMG YOU    HORRIBLE PERSON"     and then they sort of have a good laugh because she turned me down (i'm    still not sure if she knew i was asking to go
out/chill with her
wait
FEDOR
why her
besides that it would
work on her
well who knows
i mean she's so    small and cuddly
Then they were all like "you're just
a lonely    little bastard"     "yeah
kindof
with the greatest line ever "What, because you're not    getting any ASS anymore
We also had a LONG conversation about "putting the tip in" (you dont want    to know) and you wouldn't believe the FILTH that poured out of Kelly's    mouth (especially since we somehow got a weird mix of the Jen Pfaff    discussion and the freshman discussion and the Fedor discussion
it was    really pretty vulgar
Don't you love when people remind you of animals
I mean the real ones, not those ghetto "Dannonmals
We're Best Buddies
I've been to her house
She's funny and kind and very sweet,     She drinks lots of milk and but doesn't eat meat
She could probably get into Princeton, Harvard, or Yale,     Even if she took 9 AP classes, not a one she would fail
Even though she's not very tall,     every day when I see her in the hall
My heart skips a beat,     and I think its quite neat,     That although she seems a small quiet creature,     She has many an incredible feature
Nobody works harder - Its true
Once she turned black and blue
During a race she suffered a tragic fall
But that didn't stop her- no not at all
She ran her heart out, and if you don't know the rest
I know for a fact she got a personal best
Even after she tripped,     (a bit of her arm was even ripped
She went all out, and that makes her a hero     Hunter might say "she switched her gear-yo"     I know Hunter's no gangster
But that's the Story of Sasha Murr
Nothing can be all bad, or else there would be no life
We'd all just kill    ourselves and that would be the end of it
I am a firm believer in three    things, if nothing else
Love, Magic and Fate
I guess its because so much    of my life is coincidence
Coincidence is the most amazingly awesome thing; both in the very cool    way, as well as the shockingly powerful, awe-inspiring thing
Here's one    that just happened last night and coincidentally includes two of the three    things I believe in
I wrote the very sad beginning to this story, ending with "where is it    now
He needed to    buy a plane ticket to my house for part of the summer, and we previously    had little contact with him
One of his friends(Becca), starts talking to    me
She hasn't been to my website yet
Promising she will I, cheerily urge    her on, where she notes: You're very happy
Remembering back to what I    just wrote, I tell her its not so true, and send her my story as proof
Very impressed, it is found that she is DE-pressed as well
My halfway    gothic, story partly about rejection, helps her on her way as she    describes how she feels
After meeting one time, im halfway in love, and very happy
YAY
Different patterns
From "Permanent confusion"     5/2/09     I'm repeatedly reminded that I don't actually see things that differently    than other people
but why do I love post-rock so much, and not a single    other person does
It's true
Nobody likes it
And also, generally when I'm high, I have a specific thought cycle that    bothers the crap out of me
And it happens all the time
Almost every    time
And a key part of it is this: when you are in your normal state, you    will say something that indicates knowledge of this loop while sober, but    you will actually not know about it
Furthermore, only high people have    knowledge of this loop
So, you will implant knowledge that will be very    evident when you are sober, and then you'll learn it when everything's    fine, and then all of the non-high people will be informed as well
However, you'll only notice that it's out of place when you're high,    because you'll notice the things at indicative of knowledge of this loop    only when high, but everyone will continue to say them when sober, without    knowledge of the loop
And you'll have known this already, but be doomed to repeat it, because    that is also what happens on the loop
I'll figure this out later

What is this love thing anyway
Every night she haunts me
The girl of my dreams
Every night its    different, but its still the same
She's still burningly desirable, still    in that tomboyish, stuck-up way, but always the same attraction
I think I still dream her for just the feeling
The feeling of love, of    power and lust
The feeling of feeling
The mind ages quicker than the    body it seems, or else I would have no need for such dreams
The mind    outgrew physical feelings in just 12 years, but the body still feels them    stronger than ever
It's the way life shows us inadequacies
That's what    separates us from everything else I guess
Im just so tired by now
Aged too far past ripening in youth, the price of    humanity
What is it that changes us so
Why am I doomed to keep the ruse    of youth if I can see past at first glance
Can I be tired of being happy
I love the first feeling of meeting someone new
That's always the same,    always perfect
I even use the same one on every person
First shyness,    then wait
Waiting for attention never takes long like that
Then just    slowly look up an smile
Like a secret shared between lovers, complete    happiness so that even the eyes gleam beyond all defences
Everybody wants    that happiness, because it always works
Then slowly the secrets leak,    showing a never ending maze into the soul, charm making both the bait and    trap
Ensared I am, every night
But bound to me is she, or else what of the    dream
But what is this love thing
This feeling I get every night but in    complete void in the daytime
Where is it now
I think I know what it feels like now
For the longest time, I couldn't get the wording quite right on it
Only a    few people have made me feel this way so far
but I think I'm slipping
I do it a lot more now, out of habit, but I'm getting better at fighting    it off
It feels like my soul is jumping out of my skin
I remember first thinking    of describing it because of Sasha
She used to pierce my entire body with    a smile
Sometimes with just a smile
It's the kind of smile you try to capture
The one that you imagine when    someone tells you to think of something happy
When I watch cartoons, the characters are just reflections
The characters    are for me to see my own thoughts
They show me the things that have been    floating around beneath the surface
They make me remember a moment
They often show just a character's mouth
It's as if you're standing there    next to them, watching all that goes on, but they can't see you (wow
no    kidding, right
But still, you watch them smile, a generic, slow smile
And then it hits you
You remember
It's like dej`a vu
I see Sasha's smile
What happens next is nothing quite normal
I have to fight it off
What    happens if I don't
I'll probably be happy
The smile breaks my heart
I turn away
Look down, look away
But still, just one glimpse, is enough
I smile
I start grinning
I feel    overwhelmed
My body starts to tingle a little bit
The only thought that    can properly form is "Oh, my, God
The pure beauty of it is too much to handle
It's infectious
So I fight it
I clench my fists and cross my arms tightly against my    body
I anchor my soul in my body
Still, I feel such elation that could    only be explained as being freed from the mortal realm
I can imagine my    head and torso leaping out of their shells and straining to break free    from the cocoon
A blue spirit tethered down by the hands
I feel as    though I'm using my mortal hands to bind my spirit to the body
The smile that kills me
I don't see it much anymore
I always wonder if    she thinks of me in even nearly the same way as I do her
Is that why she    doesn't smile as much anymore
Because I never do
No, what's more logical is that she's just like me
She's crushed already
School
Track
An old body, a tired mind, and 60 more years of toiling    before the chance to breathe
It's a long time to hold your breath
Chipper
That's the one
Did I finish that
There's no time anyway
We're    all late already
We're tired and we want to go home
Is it time to be done now
Each breath is harder now
We just want sleep
We don't want your essays now, and we hate math homework
We're too tired to pay attention, and have too much work to sleep
In the    morning, we have a little less, and a little more to do
In summer, I'll have time to stop and think
But only if I can first heal    the damage of the year
I'm sorry I tainted that smile
Is it gone now
Forever
Why do things have to end like this
Everything is quiet
We hide
2/20/04    Mr
s Maleh <----lol anyway
mrs maleh stole my original entry for this    day because i was writing it during my spainish class when we were going    over this test that i aced
be proud of me my humble readers- you wish you    could be me
now, i will return to my normalness and continue on with salvaging my    wounded pride since my once perfect beginning was ruined
I'll try to    salvage it
Ah, theres nothing like the neglect of a personal project
I love the    stench of delay
Its been so long since i even had the time to document    all that has been going on lately
the condition of my relationship (what    relationship
S
has been rapidly deterorating
Void killed    everyone, and Neutrality is back in control
Ive discovered that too many    people know me for me to consider myself a loser anymore, but i still feel    like it
right now, the spainish teacher hates me
Even as i'm writing    this shes screeching at Charlie about his posture
Since i have    a lot of time ill just tell you how this day is going, since ive had a    very interesting morning
It started at 6:30, as usual, but
Heres where Mrs
Maleh stole my paper
Ill just continue from where i left    off
as usual, but soon it came extrodinarily apparent that this would be no    usual day
this day would belong to the one person it would truely belong    to
Good    yes, this would be the day of Good and as such i would have tons of fun    swinging along in his wake of self incurred havoc and distruction
it really wasnt all his fault
the previous night i firmly decided that i    would 1)not shave until i really needed it and 2) wear the same clothes    until I got home Monday, or felt like it
dont ask
well, soon after my awakening, my mom comes running into my room saying    something like "look at all those deer
she looks out
I soon    after grab my glasses (somthing hard to do if you're glasses are behind of    you on a tall nightstand covered in all sorts of would-be treasures i find    in my pockets at the end of the day) and go to the window
of course a second before i get there they start running off
My mom    plows through me and rushes to her room where the deer are headed outside    of
i follow her slightly less enthusiasticly- hey, im a new jerseyite now,    deer are "everywhere"
sure enough a bunch of fat ugly deer wonder about our neighbor's lawn
yay
i dont think so
later when im fixing myself up, i decide- hey maybe i should go ahead and    make myself look good today
i put in some weird spray and apply some stridex zit stuff
both of these,    as i soon discover, are not exactly the most funnest stuff to have all    over you head
when stridex says "maximum strength" they dont kid around
i applied what    some would call liberally- and my face was suddenly and unexpectantly    shrinking
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
i checked the box and sure enough it said- some shrinking of head may be    expected    well at least they tell you    then directly below that, it says-in some cases, nausea, diarrhea, and    bubonic plauge may occour
in rare cases explosion of head may occour
hey
have you ever checked one of those warning lables
anyway, that spray stuff is ok, but it leaves all this gunk in your hands
just rinse jeff, theres nothing to be afraid of
breakfast went as usual, but upon getting to school things seemed    different    jazz band was
fun    wow, thats unusual    the day really started getting to LA    I had just realized that i forgot my backpack in the band room, so i asked    crigel if i could get it
suddenly, a great idea sprang into my head
act    punk and evil for the entire day
I confided to Megan A
that I would
Mario, just behind her decides that the whole world revolves around him    and calls out to me- Delaware, you suck    uhhh
ok Maria, i mean mario    he pins me against the wall and hits me in the stomach    Megan starts laughing her brains out and they drip onto the floor    no, thats not even close to what happened, but if you want it to then skip    the next few lines
_______________________________    crigel thinks its time for me to actually start going to get my backpack    and sends me off
thats it
_________________________________________    well, i sneak into the band room and gather it up before Mrs
Phillips    notices that im an idiot
i decide to pick up a pencil on the way back so that i can just skip going    to my locker until after the period

Megan went comatose in a puddle of her own brains and    people gather around us for gangbeating and/or shoveling Megan's "grey    matter" back into her head
It's a mess
Even the brilliant Alex G

Upon arrival the guests had all stared, dripping wet and clearly depressed    he headed straight for the stairs, no longer cool but a boy in a stich    unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships
thats not what was really happening, just a song that sort of reminded me    of me in a strange kind of way
i walk up to what appeared to be a very confused and distressed crigel
Hi, uh, what are we doing
Well, im just spinning in circles not getting any work done
she shoveled a few colorful bits of paper into the large bag that    contiually sits upon her cart and turns to me
oh, right you are getting into groups and making a wordsearch out of your    made up greek/latin words
I attempt to approach my would-be desk, but alas, my backpack is still    resting upon my spine, quite painfully if i remember correctly
By now, the backpack was swinging down from my arm to be stuffed in the    corner of the room
I didnt quite throw it far enough so i did the only    thing that came to mind
I kicked it as hard as i could
Ah, Curly, you    inspire us
well, I did the three stooges thing (gee are you slow
good for comedic    action
bad for, uhh, footness
Shut up its a word
Name calling and laughing ensue as i hop about like an dork who just    smashed thier foot on a backpack and moved it an inch
Here it really gets    good
If you want this story done, you'd better email me before the end of    Feburary
there's a LOT more to it than this
like my "puppydogging" with    Kristen, and the Megan/Kristen incident and Spainish Shenagens as    mentioned in the begining
if you dont, nothing will be done- never say    never to Gord, i mean, Jeff
i'm a failure
I caved in after a day- im just so bored
I'll delete this    whole thing later, maybe after someone actually comes to my website     So then, I shout out the entire world- WHO WANTS TO BE MY PARTNER
Hey dufus, Mrs
Rigel, er
crigel     you're working with the people around you
But, but
i murmmer, they're mean     she looks at us like we're some kind of retarded chipmunks who just stole    candy from her purse
Gay is not a synonym for Stupid
This statement is true, but not the way that everyone else means it
Let's start with the basics: I FULLY support the use of "gay" as an    insult
Does this reflect (is reflect the right word here
ABSOLUTELY YES
And finally, does my personal beliefs say my logic
Of course it does, and    if your beliefs on this matter are set in stone, you probably shouldn't    even bother reading the rest of this
As for me, I'm certainly open to hearing the opposing side, but from what    I've heard so far, I'm almost positive that I won't be convinced
Also,    I'm pretty sure I'm just a big racist, and gay, as well as strong    religious beliefs, cultural traits, and other affiliations, basically    count as a race: they tend very strongly tied to the innermost depths of    people's personality and mind
But about using "gay" as an insult, I find it accurate in many situations,    and I feel that the same reasons that I have no problem using it, are also    what make me accepting of the LGBT community, and a supporter of equal    rights, especially gay marriage
What is one of the core beliefs behind "gay pride"
That we are as we are,    and that we should be proud to show it
But, going along with that pride, especially in a pride that encroaches on    arrogance (as so often does with both the religious zealots who become    gay-haters, as well as the fiery, and utterly infuriating, gay rights    fighters), comes the susceptibility to becoming stereotyped
If someone were being the stereotypical arrogant zealot, the kind of    person that has such belief in his personal faith that not even direct    quotes from the bible will stop his hatred, the general public would    gladly mock him (or, at least all the liberals would, which is the    majority where I come from
I believe that it is not wrong to describe someone's behavior as arrogant,    if that word adequately describes the behavior in either denotation or    connotation
Now, onto the part that will get me a flood of hate mail
In the American society (I'm sure it exists almost universally, but since    I don't know for sure, I won't say) there are certain stereotypes
If    someone says "guido" most of us in Jersey know what that means
At    different points in time and space, words such as "Sooners", "Bennies",    "PRs", etc
all had their meanings
Many of them are extremely    inflammatory, and should pretty much be never said, for any reason
But,    there are many that are 100% acceptable, and I believe that "gay" is in    this category
If I said "that guy's such a stoner", it would not only have the meaning    of someone who smokes marijuana frequently, but is also generally    associated with a certain type of clothing, musical preference, speech    pattern, outlook on life, and behavior
Other words have more limited range of meaning
Jew, for example, tends to    jokingly refer to stinginess
Nerds and jocks, I'm sure we're all familiar with
And so, gay refers to a set of traits that is consistent with the    prevailing gay stereotypes
I've met people that are the most    stereotypically gay personalities
They make a shockingly large portion of    all the gay people I know (6 out of 10)
Stereotypically gay people have a habit of annoying the crap out of me for    no easily explained reason
I guess if I had to place it, it would mostly    be an aggravatingly bent way of seeing the world, often including the    necessity of some random crap that really doesn't matter to anyone
For    example: the refusal to allow the use of the word "gay" as an insult
And    oh, do I mean it as an insult
And what does this all mean to someone like me
I am for gay rights, but    for no particular reason
I'm not personally attached to anyone who's    openly gay, though I know a handful
I just feel like it's the right thing    to do, and want to educate myself
The thing is: often, Gay Rights forums are often as hostile to questioners    as they are to the trolls that have nothing better to do than smear    gay-rights websites with "BURN IN HELL
I once read an honest question from someone who was like me: a supporter,    but neither gay, or with any strong reason to support
The post, on a    discussion board for "Against Gay Marriage
Then STFU and don't get one
Then STFU and don't get one
Although it was plain to see that there were obvious logical faults, I    thought it was also obvious that it was written by a supporter who was    absolutely stumped by a witty comeback
And the similarities were uncanny
There are those who feel absolutely no problem with allowing homosexuals    to marry, just as there were those who felt that there was no problem with    slavery
The point is, what if we're on the wrong side
And also, isn't    the argument of "let us have gay marriage, and just turn your back if    you're straight and don't support it: it doesn't concern you"    fundamentally flawed
How could abolitionists POSSIBLY turn their back on    something they see as morally wrong
The question stumped me too, but apparently, didn't stump anyone else
There were 2 pages of "get out of our website, you fucking Christian    Hypocrite" or "Will the Mods please kick this bigot
It seems that only "middle grounders" such as myself    even bothered to think before responding
Things I want to try
Live every moment consciously
Plan everything ahead
Structure every day
Consider the consequences of every action, even the act of thinking ahead
What are the results of every one of my actions
Learn a language, or work on    something
Read books
Get a damn job
Never consider long term effects of anything
Sleep and eat whenever
Refuse to blindly obey the sun, or the social    norm
Run when I want to: through hot sun, burning heat, or pouring rain
In the middle of the night, if I want to
Say or do whatever I want,    whenever I want
Do them when they seem    like a good idea at the time
For summer, this mostly means climbing trees    and freeing myself from a normal schedule of sleeping or eating
Body           a
Continue doing 50 crunches a day, take note of how long we can go             without fail (Thursday, January 15th doesn't count because I was             sick
Make an effort to run or swim much more frequently
c
Take Pride in physical appearance (Remember Sasha: Posture
Mind           a
STUDY: or at least show up to class more frequently
b
Take an interest in actually solving things that seem interesting           c
Talk with Owen more
d
Read books
e
Learn a foreign language (Take advantage of Rosetta Stone, and             the ppl that speak other languages around me
Soul           a
Maybe we should abandon this part
Less Anime           c
Learn to cook
d
Make my kite
Remember: the most important two things are to get back in shape, and    Actually Go TO CLASS
BUT: I want to be able to set myself up for advancement into something    better: so the second tier of importance is to quit wasting time and learn    interesting things: first less anime, then use the time for ANYTHING else
Things I need: Kite String
See you this summer
Hi Steph
It's Jeff
Well, it's your birthday, or at least birthday party
And
you know,    I've never been the best at giving the "right present
But I'm just not good at it
So here's what happened     I was thinking (though it never turns out quite nicely) that you like to    work out
Between the gym and dance, there's a lot of sweating
So I    though of getting you some water
Well, that's obviously not a great idea
so I thought of getting one of    those Nalgene bottles
You know, the ones that supposedly can never    break
and they hold water
Well, I figured you must get along somehow with water, and that this would    just sit around forever and you wouldn't ever use it
That's what mine is    doing
So then I thought of those awesome Shami towels
It's good for pools too
You can mop up as much water/sweat as you want, and then just wring it out    and it'll be dry again
Now that I think about it
that was a way better    idea than this
Whatever
The point is
I ruled it out because then you might get the idea that I    think you're a sweaty person
So not true
But you know
better safe    than sorry
Well, anyways, then I thought of racing
You, and your entire family,    enjoy racing
So
get those crazy unnecessary drivers' gauntlets
There    must be some real purpose for racing with gloves on
but all I can think    of is that it's 100 times cooler than not having gloves on
My mom said "well, if they're so into racing, she probably already has    some
darn     It's a good point
So the next idea was
a boat
For your pool     I'm about 1/3 done with it
and I have no idea how it's going to turn    out
I'll bring it over when I finish
It's made out of Popsicle sticks
And then
for my final idea
I went back to see what I got everybody else for their birthdays
Steering
Wheel
Cover
This time, it felt so unoriginal
So I got you    some fuzzy dice to go with them
Then I realized
well, she's not driving
she's making TOM drive
Hmmmm     Well, you know, if you just try, I bet you could convince Tom to put in    the sexy steering wheel cover, and then awesome hot dice
Hehehe, he'll be the coolest cat in town
Well, second to me
And
third to you (of course)
Well, either way, Happy Birthday
Hope you like it better than fuzzy socks, which I thought of too
And hopefully I'll finish your boat sometime eventually
It probably won't    float
What happened today
This story is a long one
I hope you have a comfortable chair, and a hot    cup of tea
well, once upon a time, (this is where all sorts of bubbles fill the    screen and the "bluub bluub bluub bluub
as if into a    dream sequence
If you're having trouble imagining it
try an old guy on    a rocker scratching at a long, flowing, white beard
And, by order of the    kingdom of HVCHS, there was a dire need to write an EPIC essay
This was    no ordinary essay
Unlike your run-of-the-mill essay, this was an O'Brien    essay
Almost assuredly, the prompt will contain a quote; a quote not    meant to aid in understanding and useful as background, but a quote that    is more sly than a ninja fox
These quotes are intended to fool the    reader, give a false sense of hope and well-being
These quotes are meant    to steer you in the wrong direction, and send you charging through the    dangerous Amazonian forests of meaningless themes, and full of    time-wasting direct citations
So
in order to begin the struggle through the essay
i woke up at    5:30
My eyes opened
and i could feel my pupils shrink out of the bright,    blissful dreams and into the dark reality
I focused my eyes on the clock,    a difficult task that required the utmost concentration
Drained from the effort, I was caught completely unaware, and ambushed
I was struck on the head, and knocked immediately unconscious
I arose at 6:45, and placidly looked about for my assailant
After careful    thought
I believe I was drugged, and put to sleep against my will
I had no choice, but to abandon some prewriting and get a bit of a rough    draft in before I came back that night
I bid an epic farewell to my epicly sweet mother, and told her that if i    was lost in an epic combat, that on my epic gravestone, i would want some    epic words written
I mounted my swift charger and crashed through my backyard
Once on the    road, we galloped at mach speed to the castle at Pennington, Capital of    the Kingdom of HVCHS
The sun was shining bright, and a light frost made the grass shine like    diamonds
The brisk morning air exhilarated me, and i quickly jouneyed    across the fair kingdom
I arrived and dismounted my steed
But    these lands are dangerous for those with four hooves and strong flanks
you must flee immediately
I entered the school, and my epic day began
In the Lair of O'Brien, Torture Room 212, There was a great combat over    the Coolness and Great worthiness of a GREAT and NOBLE hero
I began to    reflect on my conversation with a fair maiden of Asia earlier that    morning
I had asserted my steadfast belief that Spiderman was truely the    king of the heroes
His incredible strength and speed were equitable to    Beowulf's
He was known to the great wizards of the college in the faraway    kingdom of NEW YORK
His inner struggles had proven him to be also the    most honorable of all
And, so, i defended this hero
My words were few, but they rang out
The amplitude of    my voice was 1000000 meters high, and left a huge path of destruction
I    had matched pitch to the resonant frequency of the building, causing the    roof to collapse and crush my verbal opponents
But i was also merciful
quickly, using a great green tome of arcaic knowledge, i smited the roof    chunks and spared my opponents
we continued class
Next, I ventured forth to the COLLUSSEUM
Today's activities: frizbee
OF    DOOM
one well aimed toss of the disc could mean certain beheading
A poorly    thrown pass meant 20 lashes
And the punishment for losing
An eternity    of gymnasium ridicule
Though it may not seem a lamentable fate, the words    thrown in the Collusseum stings like a thousand bees
and bites like a    million mosquitos in the same spot
and that's no fun
My team played with great skill
They made few errors, and could throw    from here to mount Olympus
They could jump as high as a crow can fly, and    each of their hands could catch the frisbee like a dog's mouth
ON    CRACK
Yes, my team was fearsome and ferocious, but the opposing team was of    sirens
They sang thier sweet song, and distracted our every move
The    beauty of one was so exception that the others seemed like hogs compared    to her
it was the Fair Maiden of Asia, herself
Were beauty wealth, she    could purchase the world 10 times over
Sigh
I should probably start trying to    wrap this up
still gotta write Mr
OBrien's essay
As the final whistle blew over the    battlefield, we marched in to continue our important work in the castle
As the great, demanding bells sang thier two note song again, i found    myself in the Tower of the Arcane
I couldn't bear to think of the horrors    in the next rooms over
The Fiendish analyzing of the Biologist
The    Twisted experimentations of the Alchemist
I was glad i was in the class called "The Wizards Way to War"     I was drawn to the class, in desparate belief that they would teach my the    ways of magic
the old, dark ways that had the power to destroy the    world
However, what i found was this was a class on the new, bright ways    that had the power to destroy the world
We learned that a wizard can predict to a finger's breadth where a ball    will drop if rolled down a certain hill
That the world is ruled by laws    that can be measured, calculated and predicted
Today, we learned to use    this magic to shake the world, and to break glass with just our voices
That one could destroy buildings with nothing more than a hammer that hits    at the perfect time
over and over and over again
Yes, this was an epic lesson
The head wizard showed us the ways that a    spring will move, with absolute certainty, and gave us the power to    predict the motion
But then, i was sent off again to the farthest corridor of th castle, to    the great arts centre
I flew with the greatest of speed, and immediately    reached the room for the troupe of musicians
We, the Band of the Kingdom    of HVCHS were gathered at the appointed time to become the most skilled    players in all the land
We seemed to be failing
Our fearless, (but dreadfully scholorly) leader was Mr
SchWARTzer
He    tried to rule us with an iron fist, but there was a rebellion in the    Saxophone section
We were constantly at war with his strict ways, and    refused the silence that he tried to force upon us
Though our only weapons were smiles and giggles, we were vigilant, and    made every effort to attack
However, our alliance began disbanding
There was DISHARMONY (pun TOTALLY intended) among the Alto Division
the    only active group in the struggle for freedom
What was the source of this    strife
Well, nobody really likes me
and the one girl had ridiculous    mood swings and the one guy is kind of angry all the time, and the other    guy
he mostly just wants to do his french homework and make fun of the    people around him
Ah
but I knew the price of freedom wasnt cheap
and by special    request, i was recalled to the battlefield of Band
in time normally set    aside for Consuming GREAT quantities of food at the Mead Hall
There, i easily performed the feats he requested of me
Though in many    places my movements were unpracticed an unskilled, i narrowly slipped by    the cracks, and faked my way through the arduous tasks
And THAT, is what happened
i WAS going to keep goign with the rest of my day
but its kind    of taking a while, and i need to do my essay
See you tomorrow)          On 5/7/07, Stephanie Yang <stephanie

Why do I suddenly have immense pity for these people who are doing the    walk of shame, and not just the hilarity
Therefore, Lost my balls, and    have a vagina
And are they not pitiable
Most importantly, in the trait of pitiableness, is that they were dumped    shortly after they had given sexual pleasure to the object that would    shortly betray them
This is the white man's anger
This is the sort of thing that happens
GOD I hate the note-writing interface of facebook
Integrate an autosave feature PLEASE
this is the third time i've written a long-ass note on facebook to have it    completely deleted by a misclick followed by the backspace button
This one was good too
title\Some things you just have to see for yourself
I'm in the middle of writing something that has something to do with the    last note, and this: Some things you just have to see for yourself
I    haven't actually written it, but I have an outline going
It's about romance
betrayal
doing things, just to see if you can
and hopefully seeing if I can get an audience emotionally invested
But so far, it hasn't gotten anywhere, and when it does, I don't know how    it will turn out
I'm also not sure I want to let anyone see it when I'm    done, but I'm pretty sure I can motivate my self to actually do it if I    publicly announce that I intend to
Otherwise, it'll always stay an outline
Steamed
I'm hungry
One thing: my wrist hurts
This wasn't in the original one, but I was    kinda pissed off at Facebook, so I went and played Guitar hero for a    while
Let me clarify
A long while
A while longer than I should have
Now my left hand hurts
Especially the wrist and pinky
I've graduated to    expert
and it hurts
I still haven't finished GH3 on hard yet, but it's    getting pretty much impossible, so I'm starting on expert before I go    back
That way it'll seem easier
Magic is still real
A big mistake     The whole thing was a big mistake, or maybe a little miracle that happened    to be inconvenient
But whatever it was, I don't know how it happened, and now I cant stop    thinking about it
I don't know what love is, and really what the distinction is between    having a "crush" and being in love is, but I still don't think I have    either
If love is just not being able to think of anything else, then I have it
And I have it bad
If it's a physical feeling, a constant pain or elation- then I'm cleanly    innocent of it
Its all I can think about, this constant loop of distraction
its pretty    annoying
I don't think I care much for it at all
I want that hair
Its    so poofy, like cotton candy-its delicious
And eyes- supposedly hazel- but    I swear I saw greens and blues swirling about all over
Hazel is    brownish
isn't it
And now, whenever I'm around her, it's like I can't even talk
I just feel    so inadequate
Or maybe its just that every time I see her, I think of    that dreadful note
Ever since that day, there's been nothing on my mind    but her
I don't really like the whole "secret love letter thing" its just so
too
just too "absent" It left me with a feeling- is this right
Is this    for me
There was only one way out, and it was a horrible choice
It was like    choosing to be haunted every night with guilt, and living every day absent    of feeling
I chose the guilt
I lied
I said "I forgot who I was supposed to give this to, and it was so loud in    the hall, and I put it in my mouse and forgot about it
all lies
It took me days to come up with any solution at all
My mom thinks im    doing drugs and wont let me out without a good reason- not that I usually    have anywhere to go
My whole family isn't a big believer of dating in highschool, and I    followed that belief, but putting my own twist on it
Its ok to go out,    but don't do anything
major
I had to lie, and tell that phony story, or else I'd never know, since    then i've been depressive in my classes, avoiding most everything, and    just so distracted
Like the life had been sucked out of me
The only    thing I could think about was that note, and her
So I learned- there was no mistake, it was all true
It was all for me
At first I was relieved, but her verbal confessional was costly
suddenly the world was alive in gossip- I suddenly knew what it was to be    caught up in all that drama- once a bystander, now right in the middle of    it- the subject even
But still- I cant even go out
I cant even think
Its like having ADD-    only focused on one thought
Wanting and knowing     Everyday when I see her, I know I WANT to put my arms around her, and hold    her tight
but I KNOW I shouldn't get involved with someone so unwilling    to love me back
When I meet her in the halls, I WANT to hold her hand and kiss her lips,    but I KNOW I probably shouldn't
When I think of her, I WANT to be with her, be the one to hold her tight,    but I KNOW she's already turned me down
The only thing is
I want her to change her mind, and finally say yes to    me, and now I don't know if "no" is the only answer she has
Will's story     You know how sometimes you hear the meaningless threat "I'm going to beat    you"
Well, this is a story about that
Well, see, Will is buff
Its because he does swimming
kind of obsessively
He'll be swimming around top speed for hours and develop a host of pains,    and do it again the next night
So, he's Ripped
He's also vaguely in running
He did one season of X-C, and is doing track    now (while coming in sore every day from swimming
and then of course    hopping back into the pool after track)
The point is, he's gone against    everything sacred in the world, and abandoning distance running to become    a sprinter/jumper
Today
Monday, March 13, 2006
is when it all went down
Well, Sarah is a cool person
YAY FOR SARAH
WOO
Well, she was struggling for life during Saturday's distance workout
It    was not only a distancer workout, but also our little informal time    trials
The point is, I saw her during math, and asked what a crazy fast    sprinter like her was doing a distance workout for
Honestly
She rolls her eyes at me,    and give me a "duh" look
Honestly, how mean
SHE'S a MEANIE FAT HEAD
I move to    Will
you're not a distancer
Fine
I'm going to BEAT you
Will sort of just shows me his shoulder
He has this freaking huge piece    of meat there
Like a FLANK steak
Hahahaahahahahahahah
Sorry
I look around
Mr
Shrager is basically standing right next to us
I    look around for someone who might actually care
and start HAMMERING on    his arm
Its like a friggin' rock
After about three or four hits, I get SO tired,    and the rest are sort of on the wimpy side
Still, I'm actually hitting    him as hard as I can
FINE
He shrugs and casually walks to his seat
That really hurt
I'm going to cry
My hand is bright red, and    Will just sits laughing
I start just cracking up, and end up laughing so hard I do get a little    teary
For the next, like, 5 minutes, I keep whining about how much that hurt
The moral of the story, is that Distance is the way to go, Don't get in    fights with swimmers, and Flank is a cool word

I have seen problems conceptually not    too different from this one on contests for (admittedly somewhat elite)    middle schoolers, and I think that summation of geometric series, which is    the only thing in I use in my second solution, and it is generally taught    before calculus and certainly in calculus at the latest, since its    derivation comes from the most basic of limits
My first solution is a    little more primitive but less generalizable
Anyway, though this never happens on the internet and I usually stay away    from this sort of thing (I only just discovered the xkcd blog for the    first time today) I will post in the hope that my post clears up the    questions that any of its 3 readers might have
The question is asking what fraction of Bob's wins should come on his    second turn
Soution 1: Out of all possible outcomes, the probability of Sue winning on    the first turn is 1/6 and the probability of Bob winning on the first turn    is 5/36
If neither one wins on the first turn then we are back to the    same situation, and the probability of Bob winning is unchanged
Hence the probability that Bob wins given that it was won on the first    turn is the same as the probability that Bob wins given that it was won on    the second turn, and so on, and is equal to the probability of him winning    overall
Then we take the probability of a sequence whereby Bob wins on his second    turn (125/1296, as computed by many people so far) and divide by 5/11,    which is 275/1296
Solution 2:     The probability of Bob winning on turn number n+1 is 25/36 the probability    of him winning on turn n, because     (1) the chance of the game continuing for two more rolls (i
e
one more    turn) is 25/36, and     (2) after the game continues past Bob's first turn we have reduced to a    situation where he wins on his nth turn
So we have a geometric series: if P1 is the probability he wins on the    first turn, then the sum of the probabilities of him winning on his    different turns is     P1 / (1 -25/36) = 1, since it is given that Bob won
So P1 = 1 - 25/36 = 11/36     11/36 * 25/36 = 275/1296
No need for approximations, and no trickery    involved
Notice that this is also equal to the probability that Sue wins    on her second turn, given that Sue won
So David is correct in that all    that matters is the probability of the game continuing long enough for    each player to get another turn
Here is a generalization of the problem    and it gives an answer entirely independent of which player wins:     In general, if there are r players who pass the dice in a circle, the    probability of any roll winning is 1/n, then probability of the game being    won on the winner's mth turn (given that he won) is     {[n^r - (n-1)^r]/(n^3)}*[(n-1)/n]^(rm-r)
Just out of curiosity, what was xkcd's motivation for posting a high    school math problem
Was it to test just how in touch your readership is    with its nerd roots
Did you ever do math contests in your school days,    Randall
This problem is fairly standard in that community
Don't forget the Inverse Day Squared Law
Some Times, Mr
O'Brien's class makes me crazy
It's impossible to do the readings (well, it would be less impossible if I    weren't doing stuff like writing this, and watching FLCL and sleeping),    but then he gives us talks about how we shouldn't be dishonest by not    reading and taking the tests anyway
and that we should under NO    circumstances be in any way happy that we didn't read and still get a good    grade
I know it sounds awful and immoral of me
but who wouldn't
I try to read as best I can
And I've learned that the best I can
isn't very good at all
At least in my opinion
Tons of people would be    happy to be me, I think, but I'm not sure I like it all that much
So this weekend was a three day weekend
Due to massive flooding
I was supposed to finish reading Mayor of Castorbridge
That bothered me    as I was doing other things (like researching and creating a pimp'd twix-    there goes a solid 5 hour chunk of reading time
But
obviously it    didn't bother me enough to do anything about it
However, I was thinking of great ways to explain exactly why I didn't do    the reading
Then it hit me all of a sudden
And when it did, I laughed pretty hard
I'm glad I was home alone at the time
Whyyyyyyyyy Didn't you do the reading
O'Brien said in    his best "Gradgrind" voice
but I couldn't
It wasn't my fault though
who's fault was it
O'Brien has    acquired a wealth of knowledge in his lifetime
He's a deep trove of    stories
He's been around kids long enough to know when something    interesting's about to be said
He always gives this laugh and you know    something's about to happen
Maybe he's the one who makes all this weird    stuff happen
He gave the look that signaled something weird or funny was about to    happen
He gave one of his chuckles and used his body language to focus    the attention squarely on me
Everyone paused and turned
The Inverse Day-Squared Law
you've never heard of that
It's the Inverse Day-Squared Law
it seems like the sort of thing you just    pulled out of your you-know-where
It states
I scribble down W=1/D2
during summer vacation
nothing at all gets done
The more time I have to do something, the less time I'm    going to be working
Swim team cuts:     Classics       * Spiral       * Checkers       * Ponytail/Pigtails       * Mo-hawk       * HV       * Flames       * Skull & Crossbones       * Flower       * Crop Circles       * Spikes       * Braids (if you're a loser and want to keep your hair)       * Nuclear symbol       * soccer ball/ basketball/football/baseball/whatever ball       * Cross       * Arrow       * Zigzag       * "V" or some other letter that would just be there to look cool (Z for        ZORRO)       * Initials (of the swimmer, or if you're kinda weird, of your gf
awkward)       * Bulls-eye       * Squares or other random shapes popping out       * Waves       * a small, simple artistic work (like a sun shining on some stick        figures doing something)       * Star       * Heart       * Happy face       * a Word (GO, SWIM, etc
but make sure the person who cuts your hair        can spell)       * Past Experiences       * Random tufts sticking out
for no reason (looks SOOOO funny,        probably because its just so horrendously stupid looking/ugly) (I was        the victim of this my freshman year)       * The double Mo-hawk            * Peter Novabilsky's was actually pretty cool
until he wore it             for like 3 weeks
Can go over middle in the regular way
but don't be        limited to being normal (go from front to back, for all I care)       * Bowl cut (get a perfectly horizontal cut all the way around, then put        it up in a little tuft
the plus side is that the day after, you can        just put it down and you look exactly the same as you used to
if        you have long hair
Take        down almost the entire head to
inch or less, but keep one tuft long        in the middle, and wear that up with a hair tie borrowed from a girl
Sticks straight up, or looks floppy and ridiculous
Things that I'd like to see       * Horns (I have yet to see one of these done right)       * The SUPER PART (this idea hit me one day like a ton of bricks
couldn't stop laughing for 5 solid minutes)            * Part your hair as if you were a superdork or Tommy Seabrook
it would look so funny
it looked HILARIOUS for like 20        minutes, then it just flopped over and went back to its default        state
so this would only work well for if you have gallons of gel        to waste
or maybe like 5 bottles of hairspray)            * if you want to see my test, just ask me- its on my phone
these are just        the first few things that came off my mind
Or maybe the top of        their head IS Wilson
Only problem        is the colors
but you can always just have them your hair color and        explain it if someone asks)       * A pizza (or pie) slice taken out of the hair
Everything stays but one        triangular slice
Would work best when using simple shapes like        stars, hearts
as a general rule, it's a lot easier to do them by        hand, but you can always try something new
screwdriver,        scissors, goggles
the possibilities are limited only by your hair        cutting skillz
Yes
skillz with a Z
Maybe a symbol from another language

Also keep in mind I'M NOT A CAPTAIN
so none of this is really
And remember, the night that we do the cuts, you can't let the girls or    the coaches see the hair until the next day at school
That's important,    so bring a cap to practice and WEAR IT
And EVERYONE should do SOMETHING    to their hair, but Sr
the rest of you    don't have a great excuse
And
most people will be cutting it ALL off the day after the psyche    because your hair WILL look rididculous
And anyways, it's not like you want to keep your disgusting,    chorine-destroyed hair anyways
This way you get a fresh start
AND YOU GO FASTER WITHOUT HAIR
COUNTIES IS IMPORTANT
Also to keep in mind: we will be in school, so I don't have to remind you    that the hair cut should be considered school appropriate
right
What is this love thing anyway
Every night she haunts me
The girl of my dreams
Every night it's    different, but it's still the same
She's still burningly desirable, still    in that tomboyish, stuck-up way, but always the same attraction
I think I still dream her for just the feeling
The feeling of love, of    power and lust
The feeling of feeling
The mind ages quicker than the    body it seems, or else I would have no need for such dreams
The mind    outgrew physical feelings in just 12 years, but the body still feels them    stronger than ever
It's the way life shows us inadequacies
That's what    separates us from everything else, I guess
I'm just so tired by now
Aged too far past ripening in youth, the price    of humanity
What is it that changes us so
Why am I doomed to keep the    ruse of youth if I can see past the fac,ade at first glance
Can I be    tired of being happy
I love the first feeling of meeting someone new
That's always the same,    always perfect
I even use the same one on every person
First shyness,    then wait
Waiting for attention never takes long like that
Then just    slowly look up and smile
Like a secret shared between lovers, complete    happiness so that even the eyes gleam beyond all defenses
Everybody wants    that happiness, because it always works
Then slowly the secrets leak,    showing a never ending maze into the soul, charm making both the bait and    trap
Ensnared I am, every night
But bound she is just as much, or else what of    the dream
But what is this love thing
This feeling I get every night but    in complete void in the daytime
Where is it now
Yeah, right
Not me
Not now, you should say
When you're not even old enough to drive,     You don't need to care
When you're the happy-go-lucky child,     These things don't matter
When the world looks down to the streets,     And sees you there, dying,     Then you need to open your eyes     And not before
Right
When you're too young to know about politics,     And too delighted at the world,     You'll never be alone, Right
When you're just sober enough to realize     That JUST MAYBE you were wrong     Give me a call
When you come back     From the tour of popularity,     And finally kick the powerful drug     Of happiness, come pay me a visit
When the lies of the "friends" who don't care     Are finally deciphered, come to my room
It's not very clean, and there's noone around
Just me and myself
Just me and an endless stack of stories     That only I have the time to read
Just me and my wild imagination
Just me and this paper,     And this pencil     Writing and Hoping     Writing and Hoping you'll come
In some ways, it is a bit of a relief being back on paper
Less    structured, Less distracted, and always more free to be corrected by an    endless line of whiny people who hate me
I'm much less pressured to do    actual work, and my hands shape the words more like hands knead clay, as    opposed to the mechanical click and whir of a computer
The rigid keys    make a humble attempt at creation, while on paper, the universe truly    obeys me, as if I were a god
In the quiet of a room, on a simple oaken    table, with distant clicks of a drying machine and the TV bringing a    steady beat of creation like music, I can hear my thoughts echo in my mind    through misty darkness and bring out the bare, simple light of creation
Brightening the inside world of my mind, effectively altering the outside    world, I control the universe
My editor helps, too
But in the end, isn't that we all want-perfection in someone else
But why, we all ask, would someone perfect want some dopey kid like me
Well, tell me, just one reason, that you aren't perfect
Perfect for someone like me
Am I perfect for someone like you
Sometimes I don't know, and sometimes I don't want to know
I always torment myself with the if and whys for everything insignificant,    but then jump ahead into the thing that I can't handle
Don't ask why, I'm just as lost as you are, probably
If I had all the answers, I wouldn't need someone perfect like you
It's a beautiful world we live in, but riddled with stupid petty problems,    and full of hate and so it seems doing anything to promote that beauty is    futile
The world is physically beautiful, it came up once while discussing this    that "there's not a single person I see over there that isn't good    looking
Full of differences, but full of just about anything worth    longing for
Look outside your window, or just think for a moment, what lies out there
Trees
Grass
Hills
The sun
Yes, but what else
Just that
Or is there beauty in the quiet winds, blowing, gently caressing the every    leaf, so the hill dances in a beautiful symphony
The conductor and the    instrument- wind dances to its own accompaniment, its vocals rising or    falling with the gusts, painting a serene, invisible picture with the    brushes of grass
the sun adding its own dazzling beauty, so pure and rich    it could only be compared to the deep dark eye of a lover, so limitless,    so perfect you feel unworthy to raise your own gaze to it and bask in that    infinite power
To feel the soft lenses wrap around you and fill you with    warmth
That safety and serenity of quiet solitude that could only be    disturbed by the ever changing landscape around you, all unheeded while    grasped in the fleecy blanket of timeless silk
And what kind of beautiful place wouldn't have that
Those feelings of justified security in something so intangible some spend    entire lives seeking it, yet so solid that the volumes of ideas on it    could take an entire lifetime to view, and yet only barely scratch the    surface
Such a mysterious force that it causes the impossible quite    regularly, and is doubted to be ever fully explained
Something quite so simple as well, that it only takes four letters to    explain at all
Love     It's a big world we live in, full of the impossible, the mysteries, and    most of all, beauty of it all
I hate ghetto math and poor excuses for real science
But, of course I'm guilty of both
For one, a lot of people have been talking about fudging numbers to get    lower percent errors on their labs
I've done this, but suddenly it seems morally reprehensible
Maybe its    because we're in college
Maybe I'm just being a dick about it, and I WOULD feel the same way if I    still had to deal with BS labs
But that's ok
Another thing is that I hated when they taught pressure in chemistry
I,    not having read the book, did a sweet physics proof to understand how to    compare the densities of things in columns, and how pressures can equalize    the two columns, using by net force=0
It wasn't that hard, and certainly very easy to understand
So, I explained it to someone who wanted my help on the homework, and    they're like "man
I don't remember any of this
you must be making    stuff up"
that's what you do for problems
you find the way to get    the answer using what you know
That's KINDA the idea of learning
5 minutes later, he comes back and complains that I gave him the wrong    shit
And that the answer's this bullshit equation of gdh=gdh
And his reasoning: That's what they did in the book, and that's the ONLY    right way
So, pissed, I go to Dan, who wholeheartedly agrees that my way is right,    and ends with the same result, but uses REAL math and physics
But, D
Cheng didn't want to know why or how this worked
He just wanted a formula that he could memorize and apply to whatever    numbers he was given, and get the right answer
Rote learning has been ground into our heads
The problems continued when Chris went into Calc 2 for Biological and    Environemental studies
or something like that
And never learn how to do any infinite sums
I should find out if he at    least had to do the rotational integrals
And finally, the one that takes the cake, possibly, is Luke's Pre-calc    class
Once, he came to me for help, and it was on basic trig functions, and    angles of declination
A balloon sees a mile marker at an angle of 22, and a mile marker at 20    from the horizontal
How high is he
So, I trig'ed it out, and it took me a really long time, but I got it    while he was out asking Devon and Dan Malzone
When I showed him the proof he wasn't the least bit interested, and I was    really hurt
He didn't even bother copying down my answer so that he could    compare it to what the TA did later on
I left it on my board until I knew that he left for his recitation, but    never followed up on it
But, what sparked all this again, was last night on Sunday
I got high,    but I was coming down when I helped him with trig identity based proofs
The problem was to prove that tan(pi/2 - u)=cot(u)     I looked through his book for some identity that does this pretty much in    one step, because I figure that's the sort of BS answer they'll give you    in Pre-calc, but I didn't see any, so set about doing it the hard way
Cot(u)= cos(u)/sin(u), and tan(y)=sin(y)/cos(y)     Sub in y= pi/2 - u, and put these into the original eq
to get     Cos(u)/sin(u)=sin(pi/2 - u)/cos(pi/2 - u)     Cross multiply for Cos(u) cos(pi/2 - u) = sin(u)sin(pi/2 - u)     From there, I used a calculator to prove that cos(pi/2 - u)=sin(u), and    sin(pi/2 - u)=cos(u), but that step could easily be done by hand (because    you're not fucking with amp
or freq
and you're expected to know the    important parts of the unit circle
Basically if the functions line up at    the 0,pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4, then they're definitely the same)     So, a kinda flawed proof, but one done by hand, and definitely passable,    given that the identities of converting sin to cos are in the book, and    probably look a lot better than the way I did it
But Luke didn't like it, and left, to go talk to Devon and Dan
He came    back with the "answer": some ungodly identity for cot(u) that looked    something like     sin(pi/2 - u)cos(u) - cos(pi/2 - u)sin(u) all over     cos(pi/2 - u)sin(u) + sin(pi/2 - u)cos(u)     Not even close to sure what it was, or how the fuck you're supposed to    know that, or how in god's name you're ever going to memorize something    like that for the test
And apparently, that's DEFINITELY what he    was intended to do, none of that "actually proving things" shit
I wish I could play this off as "Luke just thinks that the school is    encouraging aimless, brainless memorization," but I really do believe that    this was the intended solution, and that of every student taking the    class, only a couple would do anything even remotely like my proof
And I think that's such bullshit
What's worse, is that the test will have    that ungodly formula on the equation sheet, essentially eliminating any    need to even memorize crap
Back where I'm from, it was either memorize    random shit, or learn to derive proofs from elementary identities
At Rutgers, they encourage doing neither
What the fuck
Dan also identified it as bullshit
But he doesn't give a fuck
Sai understood though
That's comforting
God help any Pre-calc students that intend to take anything later
What's even more disturbing, is the idea that I'm possibly being encourage    to behave brainlessly, without even knowing it
This is most unfortunate
71% of Workers Commit This Indiscretion     Bosses beware
Fully 71 percent of U
S
workers are slackers
They aren't    doing their jobs
That's the astonishing word from a Gallup poll that used    more politically correct terminology than "slackers": Nearly    three-quarters of us are "not engaged" in our jobs
Gallup's Curt Coffman, who is also a co-author of "First, Break All the    Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently," told Denver    Post reporter Al Lewis that at best, these folks are clock-watchers and    break-takers
At worst, they mock their bosses and undermine the companies    where they work
Coffman is an expert on employee behavior, having studied it closely for    more than 20 years
The news gets worse
The best employees are the newbies--the ones who have    been on the payroll less than six months
They aren't jaded and are still    trying their best
The worst workers are the ones who have been with the    company a long time
What causes employees to become disengaged
Primarily, it's having to    perform useless tasks
The Denver Post got this confession from a slacker    who worked at Hewlett-Packard in Denver and was recently laid off due to    the merger with Compaq
Not surprisingly, he wouldn't give his name
I knew what was coming
So why would I kill myself on the project I was    working on
One who wants to sabotage the    company
Coffman estimates that 17 percent of the workforce fits into this    category, whom he describes as "actively disengaged
Coffman's recommendation
This is harsh
He says the bottom-performing 20    percent of many large organizations should just be fired--and that    includes managers
Top 10 Signs You're a Perfectionist     It isn't easy being a perfectionist
You have to be persistent, detailed,    and an organized high achiever
You must have exceedingly high standards    not only for yourself, but also those around you
You have to conceal your    imperfections from others in an attempt to always project an image of    perfection
Ten Top Signs Your a Perfectionist      1
You can't stop thinking about a mistake you made
2
You are intensely competitive and can't stand doing worse than others
3
You either want to do something "just right" or not at all
4
You demand perfection from other people
5
You won't ask for help if asking can be perceived as a flaw or        weakness
6
You will persist at a task long after other people have quit
7
You are a fault-finder who must correct other people when they are        wrong
8
You are highly aware of other people's demands and expectations
9
You are very self-conscious about making mistakes in front of other        people
10
You noticed the error in the title of this list
Source: The BBC News Online     Of course, no one can be perfect
So in their quest for perfection,    perfectionists place their health in peril through stress and anxiety--and    they can make other people's lives miserable
Working for a perfectionist    boss is really tough since he or she will have unrealistic and    unreasonable expectations of employees
The BBC News Online notes that some physicians think perfectionism is a    medical condition that should be categorized as a behavioral problem or    psychiatric disorder
extreme forms of perfectionism should be    considered an illness similar to narcissism, obsessive compulsiveness,    dependent-personality disorder, and other personality disorders because of    its links to distress and dysfunction," Canadian professor Gordon Flett    told the BBC News Online
Flett has identified three types of perfectionists:       * Self-oriented perfectionists, who expect perfection of themselves
How can you spot a perfectionist
Look for people who
have a "self-promotion" style and try to impress others by bragging or    displaying their perfection
shun situations in which they might display imperfection
have a tendency to keep problems to themselves, including an inability    to admit failure to others
A scary warning for perfectionists: The impossible quest for perfection    has been linked to a host of emotional, physical, and relationship    problems, including depression, eating disorders, marital discord and even    suicide
It is time to go
9/12/09     Often, I think thoughts that are a little to close to my personal life    than I'm comfortable with
Especially when I'm thinking abstractly, and    really not about my specifics
I also always want to ask them, and post    them online, but because of the possible confusions/or the actual    confusions, I cannot
This is one of them
Maybe now it's time to stop moving on
What's the difference between    running away and living like everyone else
What if I refuse
Why do I still feel this
I absolutely refuse to do that
But
It's    important for me to be able to be normal for periods of time
And
is there a time to stop moving on
What happens if I stand still    amongst the motion of living, and press my back against the steady, swift    stream
The answer is probably what is discussed in "5 cm/s"
And is that evil
IS    IT WRONG
Such anger
And is it anger
there are no words for it within    my vocabulary
When I give it a name, I can give it a face, and then stare    into its eyes
And when that happens, will it be because it has already    consumed me, or be because I finally have the strength to face it, and    destroy it
Or just finally doing one of those things, that will let me    live with it without regrets
All I know is, I now realize that my legs will take me as far as I'm    willing to go
What happens when my legs aren't strong enough to carry me    all the way back as well
I assume it will be as in GATTACA
It's shorter    to the other side, and you'll die if you don't reach land
Never save    anything for the way back
It doesn't matter if you fall, just that you    jumped, and reached the goal
This may be a horrible line of thinking
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous thinking
Dangerousdangerousdangerousdangerousdangerousdangerous
Dangerous way of    thinking

Enough with trying to figure it all out, nothing's going to help now    unless she uses that damn coupon and bails me out
But I know she wont, so    I have nothing better to do but let it all come out on paper
Its kind of    ironic seeing as we weren't really ever together, and this wont ever    really be on paper
So, this is what happened, I was dumped like a ton of bricks from the back    of a dump truck
Ok bad analogy, but for this one let's let it slide
Now    all that's left is to use it all as material for people to read and catch    one glimpse of what happened
Especially now that that's all it'll ever    be
Its true, I saw it coming and did nothing about it
But if I had the    chance to take it all back would I change anything
I'd change only one    day
I'd change today
All it would take is me finally giving in to what I    want, doing everything that I want, rather than hold back because it    doesn't make any sense
I cant concentrate, but I always figured that writing is the one thing    that can just go
I don't think I can do this
Just now, I pretty much    feel like falling sleep and sleeping though school tomorrow
I really want    to, but I have a feeling that it wont work out so well
Which is funny,    because that what happened with Marissa, it didn't work out so well
Seriously, I cannot believe right after she dumped me she said "so what'd    you think of my Social Studies essay
Personally, that is seriously like acid from    the asp, or as I said "Wow, you're like, pure evil
And do you believe it
I asked "Are you breaking up with me
But anyway, now I'm feeling kinda better, this was a good idea
Gahhh I    can't believe it
She was planning it for like weeks and weeks
When I    plan things out for that long it never quite stays a secret
and hers    didn't either
I tried my best, I just didn't know with what
I thought    she was just pissed at me for say
not listening, or like not being    nicer to her, or respecting when she didn't feel exactly the same as I    did
It was none
it was for not behaving like the average horny-ass guy
I    mean, what the hell
Who's ever heard of such a thing
Anyways, now I know    that high school girls are some crazy folk with all sorts of things going    on in their minds
Unfortunately, they will not just come out and do it    themselves if nobody else seems like they're going to do it
damn)     Well anyways, now I'm kinda torn on the subject of what to do with this
at the top it says (or if I took that part out, it SAID) "this wont ever    really be on paper
so what do I do with it
Ordinarily, I would just    print out a copy, put one online and wonder about the school showing it to    everyone in sight
Or
if it applied to only a select person or peoples,    the said group would get to see it and nobody else would have a clue
this is rather
a private subject matter
So what now
Anyway, back on the subject
on my home computer where this was written    on 11/6/05 I wrote on the subject name/file name "why nancy dumped bill"    now this is a very good story and I think it should be told
Well see, way    back for absolutely no reason, my dad made my brothers and I get this book    on the SAT
Of course now the SAT is set to screw us all over because of    the essay and whatnot, but in this book there were lots of words
lets    call them SAT words, and they were very long and fancy and meant lots of    regular things
And they were put onto these rings (like three ring binder    rings
only without the binder and each ring is separate)
So anyway,    one of the ones I was looking at for no reason was very nice in nature and    so I thought it would be fun to share
On the front it said "frivolous    (FRI-vuh-lus)"
The back is much better "adj
lacking in seriousness;    self-indulgently carefree; relatively unimportant
Seriously, look at the last    definition
Well, every card has a little sentence or two using the word "Though Nancy    enjoyed Bill's frivolous, lighthearted companionship, she sometimes    wondered whether he could ever be serious
Eh
Anyway a long time ago I showed Marissa the
original quote because I    thought it was cute
Now its just funny as hell
Well, I think I officially, like, own Cael
I mean I seriously called    him out, and he just went ahead and asked Marissa out
I mean, what a    bastard
So I think he officially owes me these two terms
of    SURRENDER
A) they will NOT under any circumstances make out in front of    me
I mean for one its Cael
nobody needs that, and B) they're both my    friends and with Marissa, it was so much more than that
But anyway
wait
I just realized that I accidentally put B as why they shouldn't make out    in front of me, but it was actually supposed to be my second term of    surrender
I MEANT     B) Cael gives me piggy back rides through the halls
That seems pretty good
Wow this is getting pretty long, and I've forgotten a lot of stuff
Ok so I was eating dinner when I realized a bunch of stuff
for one, I    really would rather not have my personality drastically altered by any of    this
That would suck so much
I would give
a lot to stay the way I am    forever, even if it does piss a lot of people off
Everyone reading this    will agree
I just
yeah, don't bother telling me again
God, some people need to learn to read the line after something that's    confusing and/or will evoke response before responding or getting all    confused
That includes me
So I would actually really enjoy life if I went along life still    completely captivated by Disney movies and taking naps and thinking girls    are weird
Oh yeah, well, that and for another thing girls are like
weird
I mean    seriously
The things girls do
Well yeah, girls just do a lot of weird    things, and then they ALWAYS, always blame other people for doing the same    things
The difference is (for all the PO'ed girls right now) is that guys    are A) lazy little lazy things, I don't have a good analogy that doesn't    involve swearing, and B) proud to admit they are hypocrites and lazy to    boot
I'm not the laziest so I'll always point that one out
Well, I'm not sure I have much else to say, but yeah
I got dumped, and they always say that the first one is the worst
Then second is the best
and third is the one with the hairy chest
Wait a minute
Camille, Camille,     Strong as steel
Has two heels,     But no wheels
As to her meal,     It won't be veal
She can use a potter's wheel,     And make a nice pot
fo' real
For a penny she bought a seal,     "Oh man
Not because of the feel,     But because she loves animals with zeal,     And would rather have a banana (though not the peel)
She loves pirates that steal,     Much better than ninjas that conceal
Being on a pirate ship with a keel,     (with Orlando Bloom, no less) would be ideal
She'd love to be sailing on the water teal,     Johnny Depp's abs she'd like to feel
We met in Vegas, by the roulette wheel
I was drawn by her sex appeal
When I used Zoolander's BlueSteel,     She let out a squeal
We hopped into my automobile,     It was like a dream surreal
We drove off to Brazil (say it "Bra-zeel"),     And made a new life, flat broke from nose to heel
So there's the story of Camille,     Seems Unreal
That's because it is
Deal with it
do so in song
You know, that shirt makes it very hard for me to hate you anymore
Owen's been trying to get me to talk to you since I told him about the    last time we talked
I want to know something
but the act of asking will be a betrayal to    myself
Is it evil be live a blissful lie
Is "happy puppet syndrome" so    bad
Wouldn't you rather be misunderstood than miserable
I Don't know    what I want anymore
I don't even remember if I'm looking anymore
Ok, oh geez, I really could not handle that at all
I'm really not sure    why
Things within me are very
problematic sometimes
Umm
Let's start at the beginning
Actually, I forget what the beginning was
I think I forget everything    already
If I simply start somewhere, it can be said to be the beginning,    and the things that happen before it are simply given negative values
Also, because of the way my (and probably everyone else's) memory works,    if random things happen, then they will happen, and I will put them down    on the paper, and then they will be set there, and then we can move on,    having learned that extra thing
I'm terribly sorry that this might all be random jumble, but I'm trying    not to miss anything
That's what always bothered me about writing letters    and those sorts of things
It's a selective thing: you weed out the less    important things, and make important things more important and clear, and    you DO gain a lot of insights into what's commonly referred to as    "important" but don't you miss a lot of things
It always bothered me that    it's unacceptable to put in the words "ummm" into formal writing, when    it's probably much more accurate that way
Learning is a process, and    although flashes of insight are common, isn't the struggle equally common    and equally important
Although, if only the most important insights are    given, then each individual will undergo the important process of    individual struggle, learning more than would by simply following the    footsteps
And also: for fast learners, won't there be a lot of boredom if    the complete series of steps is taken
Everything is problematic
Oh geeze
I really wish I could stop
I feel so
Extrodinarily selfish    like this
Which leads us nicely into the very first point
Sorry it took    so long
But that seems to be my brain
And my personality
The first thing is: I am very sorry for being selfish, and generally a    jerk
I wish I could have said this to you in person
Because, I really do    mean it, and even if I feel like sometimes I'm not exactly conveying these    things as well as I should be with all my random hand/body/face/whatever    object happens to be near me motions, I feel like in this way, you will at    least see that I am trying to show you that inside of me, I really do mean    it
Now, it seems that all you will see is the result of my fingers    telling the story of how incredibly frustrated I am with myself that I    really am way too selfish, and generally a jerk
Allow me to clarify
For the very first thing, I'm very sorry, but the walk that I said I would    be taking got postponed, because all of a sudden, a huge flood of thoughts    threatened to engulf me
I guess it's not that sudden, because most of    them have been floating around in my head for days
And also, I'm sorry    that most of those thoughts sort of immediately flew right out of my head,    and most of them seemed like they were very good ways to get the message    across that I am sorry
I think that this is a major problem
By this, I mean the whole issue of    everything
I wrote that sentence a while ago, and now I forget what it means
Well, the first thing it could mean, is possibly that the whole issue of    everything literally means the whole issue of everything
Recently, I'm    becoming more and more aware of how little I enjoy being human
Humans are    so terribly flawed, and really poorly designed I think
I'm pretty    positive that no human, or collection of humans could ever hope to create    something better, or something even remotely as complex, but it really    does seem like there are a number of things that are terribly flawed
Statements like these are what drive me to dislike the human condition
Because obviously, I really do enjoy being human
Or at least, I can    hardly imagine a life that is not human
And so flawed
It's so great
Especially, when things work out excellently, and you're like "How in the    hell did this awesome thing happen to me
There's like
no way
It's    like
no way
You're saying that this person over here likes me
That's    absolutely outrageous
It's sentences like this that make me wonder about the whole    issue of whether or not it's evil to manipulate writing
I really would    feel evil if I left out this thought, and it really is important
And if I    left it out, hopefully it would cause you to think "hey, no way, I thought    the same exact thing once", but do so much less
like a selfish person    would
Arg
Geez
Everything is problems
umm
Is that possibly it
I wish
I really do
If that were the extent and the entirety of    everything that I was really sorry for, then I would think "that's pretty    bad", but now that I know how bad things REALLY are, I guess I think more    accurately "that's not so bad
Or maybe not
Well, our last night at Rutgers
I was really pissed at him
For wanting    to back to Livingston
And for being really drunk, so he needed me to take    him back
Started walking ENTIRELY the    wrong direction
I think it's obvious
I might be totally    wrong) things were very different from how I saw them
Whatever it is,    it's increasingly obvious that I blamed him for no reason
And that my    anger in him was definitely not justified
And that, pretty much, I was    just really, really stupid, and I totally regret it
Arg
I wish I could get some input to verify some facts
But
that would    be really not good at all
I think
It's hard to tell
It really is
Everything is terrible
I'm having a really tough time
Sorry
Ok, now I think I'm just whining about stuff
That's really not good of    me
Sorry
Ok, geez
Problems
Stop
Sorry
I should stop doing that
Ok, I will
Let's get back to this
Let me tell you a story
Once upon a time,
Hmmm
so
remember anything important yet
No
Yes
If you think you'll forget it by reading further into this
Write it    down here     ________________________________________________________________________     ________________________________________________________________________     That should be good for a few key words so you won't forget
And now, onto something else
Do I get a PRESENT
WHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEE
Oh well
Now let me see
oh yes
fortune cookies and peeping in peoples
Well, it was the weirdest thing
I was walking down the hall, and I see    two of my friends talking, so I go over and say hi to them
They both sort    of ignore me but they knew I was there
As I stood there waiting for their    attention or something, they were talking about their uneasy situation
The one on the left- her and her boyfriend whom I also know - are always    together, much like us
Only
they aren't big wimps who wait for the    other person to make the first move
ha-ha, ha, ha-ha
So the one on the    left is telling the other that she's constantly with them when they're    trying to have a moment, or whatever
She brings up an example
The other    one is just a friend who wants to be with them and fully understands they    need some space, but
yeah
Then I decided to leave, but I thought about Sophie, and her interesting    condition of being near both of us in quite a similar way
Sometimes I    feel like I'm accidentally ignoring you by being around her as we walk    down the hallway
More oftenly ("oftenly" is not actually a word
for    some odd reason) we're all being dumb and just goofing around as we walk    down the hallway and you try to ditch us
it never really works
Maybe    you should try harder
Anyway
Onto a NEW story
Something pretty interesting happened
There    was this fortune cookie
It was magical
Or maybe just weird
Alright so    here I am just enjoying an afternoon snack and I see these fortune    cookies
My brothers are eating them
So I decide to join in the fun
I    grab one up and do my usual fortune cookie eating routine
You take it    with one hand
Then, only using one hand, you break it in half
Immediately eat one half
Savor that delicious taste
While eating that half, take the fortune and read it
So I'm at this step
I pull it out carefully, because the last time I had    a fortune cookie, the fortune got stuck and I ripped it in half
Oh    well
So I pull it out, and nearly kill myself
I only caught three    words, but I started choking on the cookie, and I dropped the fortune
It    said "give a kiss
Continuing on my normal fortune cookie eating routine, I eat    the second half while pondering the message
The fortune turned out to be rather boring
Ok, oh geez, I really could not handle that at all
I'm really not sure    why
Things within me are very
problematic sometimes
Umm
Let's start at the beginning

Ok, I will
Let's get back to this
I went for my walk
And then, because it was clear, I decided to stick    around and look at the stars
I saw three shooting stars too
Let me tell you a story
Once upon a time,     Forget it
There are two things:     Once, when I was talking about how Hopewell swimming is, you and Cara were    there, and you said that you found it understandable that there was a lot    of cuddling and such
I guess that you should not have trusted me since    then
But, I guess by then it may have been too late, because to find that    sort of thing understandable, you would either have to understand me, or    find the thought of cuddling with me a fun one
Understanding me would let    you know that no matter what, it would never be my intention to hurt    anyone, and although these situations may tend to become complicated over    time, we would all remain friends first, and everything else after
This    would sort things out pretty well
Or
Something similar
Finding the    thought of cuddling with me interesting could imply a few things
Either    A) Hopewell girls are like you, at the very least because I like them, but    probably more than that, or B) if you, who is shy, finds this attractive,    then others, less shy, would do it with even fewer reservations
But, essentially, from then on, I think I should possibly have been    labeled as "untrustworthy, and possibly dangerous"
At least, that's the    label I would give myself
If you're curious, your label was once "cool" then "awesome" and then    "awesome and cuddly"
Now that I think of it, it seems a bit redundant, so    we should change it back to awesome
Or possibly just cuddly
The other major thing is this: The reason I was angry at Chris was that I    blamed him for pulling me away from you
But obviously, there was so much    more wrong with that situation
And the worst part is the hypocrisy
In my    mind, I said that Chris should have known that as my last night able to    see you, he shouldn't have done anything to pull me away from you
I    should have followed that advice
It was my last night that I could see    you, and yet, I did all these things that I know you hate
And I behaved    like an ass
I let all these things come between us, on the last night I    would be able to see you
Worse still: I told you just a few nights ago, that I was in control
And    then, there I was
And for that, I'm sorry
Yo AP bio is the greatest
it rox     the best part is mrs
Lucci     obviously     it practically goes without saying     i want to share a poem i wrote about bio     BIO RULES

Jeffrey63090 [9:35 PM]:   lol    Jeffrey63090 [9:35 PM]:   oh, its just one more traumatic experience with    my name on it
Well, it seems as good a time as any to make up a completely new beginning    to my new life
Right now, im actually marveling at the newfound powers of    Yahoo Launchcast radio
But for the sake of replacing the lost beginnings    to the LGB Chronicles: The Second Year
LGB Chonicles: The second year     Oh yeah, that's a really cool title
This is going to be great, except    that im finally realizing that my life is completely gone
This time I    don't even have a base of a friend to help me up, to call if I forget    homework or anything
Im such a loser
At least when I was in DE I had    friends who thought I was at least kind of funny
What passes as funny in    this "hicktown" is completely different than before
My driveway now is    like a mile long for no reason other than that the landscapers were bored
This sucks
Boy, am I a loser
Look at me, writing this crap
What else is there to    do
Oh boy
Lets go cowtipping
No, seriously, there is nothing at all to    do
I think I aready made an enemy out of Andrew Squitire or some weird    name
He's in my band class, which aready somehow sucks more than Mrs
Bell
I'm slowing learning that this guy thinks hes funny but isn't
every    time he cracks one of his cheesy jokes, I think two things: hes an idiot,    and some how he seems like the future version of me
Too bad im really    bad with names, I know like three people in the entire school
I was thinking one morning
of being emo     for my college app
By emo, I mean that my entire thing will convey the deepest, closest    connection between us
make them FEEL that I want to go to their college     in some ways, I guess that's connected to the student council elections    that we had that day, but I didn't think about that at all at the time
Well, at first I would start off by saying     "I hate college Apps
It makes me feel like my entire life
my whole soul
is being sucked    out
ground into little insignificant bits
and spit out in a    disgusting wad of paper
I'd make them FEEL how I'm some sad little emo kid that tries so    hard and they take pity on me and I get into college
YAY
You write so Primitive
Although, it really does look more like "you writesoprimitive
Mostly we played 21 questions
Most of the subjects were    his, then Luke's, and I only did one
Luke had a tough time paying any attention
I got a little frustrated with    his guesses, especially the 4-5 different shapes, each one burning a    question, when the object was clearly a three-D shape
Importantly, I    discovered that Luke is good at picking up when I say something I mean    seriously, when I say it jokingly, and reacting in a "perfect manner"
For    example, I was genuinely pissed that he was wasting our questions with    shapes
So, I said in a joking/sarcastic manner things that I meant    seriously
The general vibe was: wtf u doing
And he gave me a look that    said "oh
I see
My current writing style is that of a 12 year old girl, writing on a    diary
ANYWAY, Erik saw my "Interesting Memories" outline on the whiteboard, and    I was trying to explain that It's helped me become more productive
Because I use my whiteboard for notes in general, especially to draw    pictures to go along with my stories, write up temporary outlines for my    journals (first usage of this word in a long, long time, Don't know if    it's accurate), and to do chem/math work
So, if I used it recently to write up a temp
outline, then I'll have to    change it from an outline, to a full story before I can clear the    whiteboard, and use it for other, more important things (important meaning    important for the moment
He    stopped abruptly, and said "your writing is so
primitive"     And wrote it down at the bottom, in neat, but cramped handwriting
Everyone's been saying this for a while
And it's similar to what I was    saying to Ammaar about how people's thoughts shine through in the way they    walk, talk, and (apparently) write
Primitive: It may be a good way to put it
I clutch the pen in an    excessively tight, ungraceful (graceless) grip
The movements are jerky,    slow, and clumsy
The shapes are rarely properly formed, and I    consistently spell certain things wrong (everywher, theatr, and others)
The letters are consistently unrecognizable
I prefer sentence fragments
Things are never complete, full thoughts
The way I think and move is pretty reflective of this
So
I guess I'm    just that kind of person
But
It does stick pretty well
He also drew a random guy with scary hair, a :D face, shoulder pads, and    one of my D's looks like a halo, and a misshapen pikachu (really big, fat    cheeks, and saying pika) (to which he says that he sees things in his mind    a certain kind of way in his mind, and they sort of distort in the process    from mind to hand
or was he saying that he carries his biases into his    mind
I should ask that for clarification) He also wrote that he likes    fighting games because it's healthy competition
Also, a mushroom above    the "the board dudes" sticker thing
Meditation is sinister
4/27/09     I was eating dinner with Luke today
Luke now has a girlfriend
We neither    understand each other, but we can get along very easily
Anyway, when we got in line for food, I took a sideways glance at his    plate, and it was considerably less full than I have ever seen it
Also,    during this sideways glance, I think that he noticed that I looked to my    side, and that he noticed that I noticed his plate was empty
He also seemed to notice that I was thinking of the time we were in our    room a few days ago, and he was talking about he was going to try to lose    weight, and also the time that he was complaining that sometimes boredom    makes you want to eat
but that's not a good plan if you're trying to    lose weight
And later on, I was thinking: I should learn meditation
So I brought it up
It would possibly be a course held at Rutgers to teach    meditation
Luke said it might be a good idea, which I was pretty surprised at, at    first
So I asked him why he thought it would be a good idea, or why he    would want to learn meditation
But a few things: most people think it would be cool to have a better    grasp on their minds and emotions, and mediation seems pretty cool to most    people today
And also: Luke said something that I forget now
I might try to ask him    about it later, but I'm pretty sure that it was something fairly standard,    like "because it would be good to know how to meditate, and it would be    awesome if you got credit for it
I'm pretty terrible at controlling my initial reactions to things
Actually, pretty absolutely terrible
That, and I'm pretty sure that, at    most time, people can see the cogs going churn-churn-churn, in my head    when they do
For example, when people tell me something about themselves    that I would have never guessed, and I start matching it up to things that    happened before, and seeing things make a little more sense
But, contrasted with that, is the quality in me that could be described as    "innocence"
At least I hope it could be
But, the problem with innocence,    is that it is almost exclusively ignorant (or naive) and is illogical
For anyone whose mind is analytical, the state of innocence is a    contradiction
But a pleasant one, none-the-less
I would prefer to be truly innocent, but it is impossible
And I would    much prefer to have the benefits of actually noticing things, and not    being oblivious
So, for someone like me, meditation could provide two    possible solutions
Either A) I enter a state where my mind is completely empty of all    thoughts
Is it possible
Can someone's mind be empty
Meditation's goal    is to clear the mind
If I were to enter this state for much of the time,    then I would be able to notice these things, but have absolutely no    recognition of them until a later time, a time away from the eyes that    would no doubt see the mental gears turning
Or, B) I would develop a greater control of the output of my mental    facilities, including initial reactions
It seems that this would be much    more difficult or unlikely, because initial reactions seem to be likely to    happen within instants, before any suppression-type modifications would    have a chance to act
So, it would be either meditation classes, or acting lessons
Either of    those could work
On the way back, it was clear that Luke's gears were turning
I only    noticed them every now and then
But they seemed to be going full swing
And I have no idea what his thoughts are like
I can't even vaguely guess
But it seemed sinister, so made me uncomfortable
I really like it when people are mentally battling
But it felt like I was    getting totally owned by Luke
Which is embarrassing to me
It also, very shockingly, reminded me of my mental duel with the fortune    reader

The hands list
1
Rosie Siuta- so soft
but
yeah, bad memories (can you say hand        sexual abuse
Sorry Rosie, couldn't help myself
just exploring)      2
Abby Stern - technically I just copped a feel when stealing her things      3
Erin Franz- same as Abby-not real hand holding, but I copped a feel        during a very slow high five
It was a little wet
4
Possibly Kelly McKnight- hah that was funny- its amazing what you can        convince people to do
5
Marissa Greco- her hands aren't the best, but they are the most fun
Woot woot for having hot wild hand sex
If that's how her hands are I        wonder
JK
6
I need to hold more hands
By "it" she meant the bouts of stupidity    that plagued her occasionally
Johnny was on cocaine
Johnny and Joe met in a dark corner of the quiet    little classroom
He said to him: I'ma gonna get you soon
And it was all over
he said cheerily, but with an ominous, sad tone in his voice
So
have anything else to say
But
you already knew what I was going to say     What
He grinned at this     See
Ok
Fine
The grin slowly faded, leaving a look upon his face as if he had seen the    end of the world, and returned without hope to try and stop it
Sunday, May 29     "I'm going to go out on a limb here, so if screw up its not my fault
It was a horrible kiss which left a loud smacking sound, and    as he backed up he said "that was absolutely terrible
Well it's the thought that counts
She said     And not working out he said exciting
I don't know what to do in situations like these
When you very clearly bait someone     And they don't get it at all
I really     Have no idea
But really, I am very frustrated     Because there are     So many things
For one, I am frustrated     Because we are failing to connect in a meaningful way
Because she is still in high school, and we are discovering that we are    very dissimilar people, I think
Also, sexually     Because she is not a skank
Which is unfortunate
Is this bad
Also, as previously mentioned     That She stinks at following my bait
Also, because I had weird sleep,     And would like to tell someone     (I dreamt of her, and in the dream, She called me out on cheating on her    -something which may occur in my future, but has not happened in my past
And so I confess, and accept punishment
Earlier in the dream, I was    caught by school police for visiting
Which is apparently a crime
I    defended myself violently, but gently
The officer grabbed me, and I    pushed him away
He tried to subdue me, but I shoved him back, and began    to back away
He reached for his mace
I broke his hand and grabbed it
He    reached for his radio
I grabbed that as well, and chucked the battery as    I left
I was previously at Lexi's homeroom, asking where Elise was
At    the time of the fight, I was at the bottom of the 300 hall
I moved    quickly to Marty's homeroom, to tell him not to text me anymore
Also, if    he told anyone who I was, or that I was here at all, Things would go very    badly
I quickly moved into the courtyard, and across the roof to where I    was parked
But this was all in the past of the dream
Presently, Elise    hit me very hard across my face
As skin and blood and spit were ripped    from my face by the unrealistically forceful blow, they transformed into    glass
As they flew, the fragments became shredded bits of newspaper
Either way, It got me to wake up at around 6:30
Annoying
This is hardly healthy, mentally, emotionally, physically, etc
Hanna's not good at mindreading
1     Hi
I think this might be the Equivalent to getting an answering machine,    and then hanging up
Hopefully, this will catch on, and I'll have started a new fad
2     Hello
Why were you up at 6:40 in the morning to send an email
that had almost    no content whatsoever
P
s
I don't do the chain letter things
Sorry :P     3     It's not a chain letter
I promise
I woke up, and I kind of missed you
so i decided to do something about    it
But, once i got past Hi
And then, right before i hit send, i decided that it was pretty    ridiculous, and put some commentary on the lack of content, and declared    it good enough
Also, i woke up that early, because I just got back from Asia
So
that's the story
Hi Hanna
that's all     goodbye
4     Hey
thats very decisive of you
thanks i guess
You're a funny kid
what'd you do there
5     Strange things are happening here
Ok, so
Hmmm     Aright
So, normally, in this situation, I would say to myself "Hey
she    said "You're a funny kid
she totally likes me
but then, I would totally doubt myself for, probably the next 10 emails
if we get that far
Hintdropping is the FUNNEST game
But
in this case, I totally miss you too much to wait that long
So, as much as I really do, ABSOLUTELY love playing fun games (because, on    the inside, I am such a girl), I refuse
If all fails,    what I was going to write    goes something like this
You're Welcome
Asia was fun
We did lots of stuff
Imagine trying to cram every important historical sight in China into 5    days
And then add about 6 weeks of food into 3
Mix in flights and drives to and from all of these place
Family we know and love
Family we never knew existed, and are expected to love anyway
Really cute cousins (that sounds really nasty)
Hot sun
Hazy skies
Inconveniences
Language Barriers
100 million super cute asian girls
About 10 different malls
Each with at least 5 stories
and tons and tons and tons of pictures
Of random junk mostly
It turns out, that I have an entirely different set of values than most of    my family
All in All, an excellent trip
And I got you something
Hopefully, you don't already have one
Hanna Stinks at reading my mind
Obviously, I was trying to introduce myself into having her hint at    wanting to get together
And she could have just been like "Oh hey, I see what you did there
why    don't I help out
why don't I just be as unhelpful as possible

You know what's absolute and utter bullshit
28, 2007))     The student voting over the senior/junior spots
The question was this: Should the spots be Reserved, then handed out,    based on merit/need (those who have higher GPA and more extra-curricular    activities would get seeded higher
To me, the obvious choice was to keep the current, unless there was an    amendment to have senior/junior "placeholders" until someone really super    qualified wanted a spot
But that still seemed unfair, because then    someone's literally stealing a spot from someone else
Not only that, but it's just more practical this way
However, Laura Mraz put up a dumbass argument for the new system
Thank God she was defeated
She saw herself as right
I saw her as a dumbass
The way she put it was like this:     First, her primary argument was that there were HUNDREDS of teachers just    BEGGING for parking spots
Think of all those poor teachers
First of all, Staff members always have, and always will have enough    parking spots
Not only do they have an exclusive parking area in the    front of the school, but the closest row in the senior lot is mostly staff    cars, and there are spaces in the back for staff
Besides, there aren't    over 250 staff members
There's a lot of parking spaces left, even if    every teacher, janitor, secretary, etc
has a spot
That argument is absolutely retarded
Even if there WERE a shortage of parking spaces for staff, the school    would simply allocate more of the student spots to staff members
I find    it hard to believe that the school would take a teachers' spot away, and    give it to a student
I told Laura, and she refused to believe me
I'm pretty sure I called her retarded at least twice
It was infuriating to try to see any way she was right
Then, I tried to drop that argument, and went on to my primary concern    with the new plan
Empty, useless spots
I could imagine being a junior with no extra-curricular, a crappy GPA, and    a license, being bussed in, and on the way seeing a half filled parking    lot
It would make me pretty mad
Empty, useless spots
Why not just fill them, if you can
Laura's response: Keep the empty, useless spots
I found it hard to believe she actually meant that
Have a half filled    parking lot
for an un-determined amount of time
Just waiting, unused,    until a "deserving" person finally gets a license
And if they don't
Why
There was no reason
Her response: "because parking spaces are a privilege, not a right"     This really pissed me off
The thought of excluding people from something    that will go to waste
for absolutely no reason
Besides that, her response seemed like a brainless Line
As if someone fed    her Student voting propaganda, and she blissfully ate it up, not even    CONSIDERING the meaning
Denying the privilege because it's not    necessary to grant it
What cost is it to grant that privilege
NONE
I would know: I'd probably in the top 40-50 in line for a spot
The hell am I going to do from September through December
I don't have a    license
I'd probably find a junior that wanted a spot and say "hey, you can take    my spot until I get a car
You might get kicked out in January or    February
but until then, Enjoy
when it would just sit there    empty otherwise

Felt like shit the whole time
Had to shit the whole time    (even though I emptied my tank

So I chillaxed the first lap

I laddered my way    up

I    was tired
but one of those mental only tireds

A bird in the hand vs
Ignorance is Bliss
The most important thing to understand is that we both live in the room    right next to the room where everything is discussed
We hear things
Neither of us is stupid
Neither of us is particularly    popular
And though we often move in similar styles, something is very    different
When we first met, I thought that he thought very much like me
But,    something is very different, and I've been having increasing trouble    identifying it, without writing any of it down
The most important things, I think are: Republican upbringing, Religion,    The Much more Open expression of feeling, Personal tragedy, and     But these are each the things that change the direction of though, not the    method
For example, Me and Owen reach extremely similar thoughts, but he    approaches things in a very mathematical fashion
I just
seem to get    there randomly
Let's write out the start conditions
For all people, they consider the current situation, then make the next    logical move
For Owen, logic is dictated by reasoning in mathematical and programming    styles
For Luke, as I frequently think to myself, he has an excess of    emotionality, a general uncaring for what others think of him, and one    other thing that I forgot
He has gotten me to talk to myself when someone else is in the room
This    I Hate
It is something that he does often, and 80% of the time, I don't    care
Our arguments escalate frequently, mostly due to the fact that I'm losing    any interest in preventing them
At one point, I was toying with the idea    of driving him off so that he would lose interest in rooming with me next    year
His increased attacks on my habits are     In the same way that I would accept being considered a pothead, under the    understanding that I give Kita and Richard (that they're smart enough to    handle themselves in any situation and that they're responsible enough not    to get caught, and controlled enough to be able to quit if they need to
We each can smoke, stay in school, and stay out of trouble
This is the    understanding that must be met before anyone can judge me fairly as a    pothead
Or will he
I don't know
Isn't it ignorance that allows me to accept a    negative label such as this
Or ignore the ever-present danger of being    caught
It's a statistical impossibility for me to continue smoking    indefinitely and never get caught
Especially by my parents and family
Each time brings the probability closer and closer to one
In the 4:00 USA showing on Wednesday of Law and Order, there was a xxx    movie store owner who was brought in to discuss a missing small girl
They    show him a picture of the girl, and he touches her lips, much to the    officers' surprise and disgust
After a brief game of "you must follow the    rules, so come back with a permit" that was cleverly worked around at the    store, we see the owner enter an interrogation room
The officers attempt    to inform him of the charges, and then they quickly jump into a deal
He says "you want something that you think I have
LETS BARTER
The same mentality of the Russian mob in a previous    episode
The ability to lie in circles, and get everyone else to play your    game
To flatly deny the truth in a way that both expresses the knowledge    that they are doing wrong, and prevents even the remote possibility of any    legal operation against him
The funny story behind your fancysauce new steering wheel cover
so we'll just take out all of    the adjectives to spice things up a little
Well, once upon a time, there was this VERY _________________ PERSON named    Sophie, and she was very ______________________ and    ______________________
Well one day, I went to her birthday party
That day was last year
I    remember I was kind of ________________________ because I was    ______________________, and Marissa wasn't there
and I didn't have the    _______________________est bonds to the other people at the party (shhhh    don't tell)
Well, anyway, at THAT party, I gave I had a(n)    _____________________ time, and everything was _____________________, but    most importantly, I gave you a very nice poem that went like this
This is the same cheesy poem     I'll write every year     Until you're 16     When driving is near     You know those steering wheel covers
I'll get one of these     Hang it on your door
Your dad might hand you the keys
Well, now
you're sixteen
So
take a WILD guess as to what your    special gift is
But
now for the special story behind the steering wheel cover
Well,    when I realized it was your birthday
I immediately thought "STEERING    WHEEL COVER
I sent forth my parents to fetch me a fetching    gift
Well, that went pretty well
until I saw it
It was pretty
so that    went pretty well too
But then I smelled it
and it didn't go so well
So we ventured forth into the dark world once more, this time
to SAVE    THE DAY
And at the great big center of commerce that is signified by lots of red    circles
We found the AUTOMOTIVE SECTION
And
every last one    smelled bad

The crazy    irony could cause lots of problems
Especially when Rosie thinks I'm being    not so subtle and talking about me and her
Anyways, about Lisa
One day, I walk into band, and for some odd inexplicable reason, Lisa was    amazingly gorgeous
I'm not talking like the Sizzling hot type of    revealing tops and super mini-skirt thing going on, this was a top notch    amplification of natural beauty
She was wearing basically a regular top    and skirt, but it just looked amazing on her
A perfect, starry
12/31/04     Night, it's when half the world is enclosed in darkness, and the opposite    is (shed
BATHED
if anything) in bright light
This night was special
This night was different from all the rest
This    night was perfect
Why was this night perfect when perfection is so hard to come by
Who    knows
What made this night absolutely, sensationally perfect
Who cares
It just    was
I haven't written anything in a long time, so this is it
This is the one    where everything just flows out
Nothing else better to do, now that I'm    just stuck here
Breaks are supposed to be relaxing and fun-filled
Winter break is    supposed to also have snow
Neither happened to their greatest heights for    me
Between a rough practice, and endless waiting for Marissa to call,    nothing happened
The spaces between the two were like a grey smudge,    broken only by the erratic bouts of sleep
In my very dreams, the two    terrible curses followed me
In my unhappy state, I only wanted a few simple things, all intertwined by    some random connection that usually only I see
First, I hated swimming
I wanted to quit, or at least do something FUN    during practice, rather than face the monotony of swimming endless laps    with no break
Left with nothing to do but listen to the sounds of bubbles    running though the water, I very quickly bored and then became physically    unwilling to continue and generally began to loathe the sport with all my    heart
Second, I wanted Marissa
Specifically I wanted a call, a chat, some kind    of communication
Better yet, a kiss, a touch, a caress, anything to    express what I felt
I was BORED out of my mind, and my mind sought refuge    from the rains of tedium in thoughts of her
At night I would toss and    turn, and in the morning have just the vaguest remembering of swimming,    and kissing Marissa in a horrible mockery of my pathetic thoughts during    the day
Lastly, I frequently occurred to me that I have no really good friends who    I trust everything onto
Normally, I would drop a tidbit onto one person,    another to the next, and so on, so that no one person knew much about my    life at all, but somehow it all escaped me and the overwhelming pressure    and frustration of not expressing myself was satisfied
Sometimes, of    course, it would all just be written down and left alone for long periods    of time
All in all, I basically was bored
This can be traced back to the very beginning of the world
The    gods were bored; therefore they created human beings," so says Soren    Kierkegaard
Then comes Thursday
Its weird because I always loved Tuesdays and hated    Thursdays, but now it's the opposite
For some reason, me and Marissa seem    to get along so much better on Thursday
Tuesdays are mine, and Thursdays    are "ours"
The reason this Thursday is different is because of Wednesday
During swim    practice all that week I had convince Tiffany to let me go raid her house    and watch Elf
And then eat her food
And then watch elf again
Wednesday    I was particularly bored, so I called her up
No answer
About an hour    later, I tried again
Nothing
Finally, about 10 minutes from the last call, I called once more, intent    on leaving an angry message
The phone picked up quickly
I found myself wondering: WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO THIS
Somehow, I KNEW that they just didn't want to pick up the phone the first    few times, and this was reinforced by the entirely too casual tone of    Tiffany's mother or sister
Apparently, she had departed to go see a    basketball game
Sighing, I sat down and gently slammed the phone into the charger
I was    in the pool room
I only called it that because that's the most accurate    materialistic description
In my mind, it was the green room, or maybe the    Marissa room
Why was it called this
Well, for one thing, there were    these two green couches, sitting opposite each other, but the pool table    was placed as an obstruction between them
This at the time seemed to    symbolize what was going on in our relationship, two things so alike    wanting to see each other, but there was something in the way
Something    that was only like us on the surface blocking our path
the green cloth    covered pool table
This was also the room with the cordless phone I used    most oftenly and so it was the room in which I would swoon over Marissa    and sigh when she wouldn't call
It was the room where I was both excited    and afraid to call her, when it seemed that there was no reason for either    emotion to exist
I looked around, lied down and sighed again
I began to think of Marissa
William Henry Channing:     To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and    refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and    wealthy, not, rich; to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with    open heart; to study hard; to think quietly, act frankly, talk gently,    await occasions, hurry never; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden    and unconscious, grow up through the common--this is my symphony
Soren Kierkegaard     Since boredom advances and boredom is the root of all evil, no wonder,    then, that the world goes backwards, that evil spreads
This can be traced    back to the very beginning of the world
The gods were bored; therefore    they created human beings
Lin Yutang     Probably the difference between man and the monkeys is that the monkeys    are merely bored, while man has boredom plus imagination
Sir Cecil Beaton     Perhaps the world's second worst crime is boredom
The first is being a    bore
Ellen Parr     The cure for boredom is curiosity
There is no cure for curiosity
Isaac Asimov     I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my whole life    fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more
For whatever the tortures of    hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse
Albert Camus     When you have once seen the glow of happiness on the face of a beloved    person, you know that a man can have no vocation but to awaken that light    on the faces surrounding him; and you are torn by the thought of the    unhappiness and night you cast, by the mere fact of living, in the hearts    you encounter
Thank you humanity
this is you're lucky day to tell me what you think     anything you hate, love, wish anything at all
about me     or anyone ELSE, but who cares
this is the internet for cryin' out loud
or at    least it feels that way     I think its weird, but what ISNT if you think about it too much     For example
most people I know would say that its normal to be slightly    more comfortable typing instead of normal writing     But think about it, isn't that a little backwards
If you're writing you    have total control, more freedom and you can do little doodles and random    drawings
If you're typing, none of that happens
You trade freedom for    structure and ease
Pencils make your hands tired, and you have to HOLD    the pencil
Here you just rest your hands on the keyboard
It sort of acts like kind of `metaphor' if you will, for growing up
Or at    least what I've seen
As a kid, you can just do whatever you want
You're not really GREAT at    anything yet, unless you have some just innate talents
Then slowly, you specialize
Some people switch into advanced math and    science classes, and others simply take tons of drawing things, and love    it
You just suddenly stop asking the same kind of questions
even stop    thinking about things in general
I miss just being able to sit in my room and stare at a random wall doing    nothing at all but thinking of the weirdest things and trying to figure    them out
Now (or is it just me) we can go whole days, weeks even doing    nothing but nonstop work, and then spend our free time going out with    friends to just vent
And I suddenly wondered
sometimes you go and write something like this-    to drop your ideas off     I remember thinking this once
you have to be perfectly balanced     Social, mental, physical-or just "structure" and "chaos"     Lets take that last one
This whole thing is "structure" its pointing    ideas into a focused area, theres structure in the very telling of ideas,    even if the structure is loose by any other standpoint
Pure chaos is like, just the ideas- theres so many of them, they just    freely bounce and float around
Its good to do that once in a while
When you're writing mostly everything is "the same color light" focusing    and brightening and making everything more distinct
If you're just    thinking and letting yourself go loose, your lights are whatever colors    they feel like being, and can change at a moment's notice
Sometimes you just need time to sit there and process things, but life    isn't usually nice like that
Everything happens at the same time, and you    have to react, or be left behind
Its like dreaming
sometimes you don't    ever feel</lj-cut>     <lj-cut text="NO TIME">I DON'T HAVE the time to take care of everything     Nobody does though, so its not much a big problem
But isn't that the wrong way of thinking
Its impossible, so don't even    try     Theres just so much to think through, too much that's just opinions
But think of it this way
If its all opinion, then nobody's wrong
So even though nobody's right, the only direction to go is forward
Nothings stopping you, not even the impossible
Theres no end on this map, just a place where you think is the end
Things just flow and ebb like the tides, bringing people along on strings    of fate
Riding on the lines in no particular direction, always going forward even    when backtracking
The only problem is theres only so much string     One string has to be stretched to see the whole world     That would explain why people grow the way they do
At first, all the    string is just big mess of yarn, or a mess of chemicals in the spider    waiting to grow out
Then it mixes and combines to form a strong cord of    life that just easily flows
Soon, theres no more, but that doesn't matter
It just stretches
and    stretches and stretches
Sure, it hurts a whole lot, but what else is    there to do
Sit there and rot
But then, you go too far, and just go too thin
Slowly, you go too far,    until finally, you break
I think that things are best    left to things
Yeah
Well, so what if that didn't make any    sense
the point is that other people are right (oh no
self    contradiction
Thinking is bad for your heart anyway, made me sadistic     Yup, yup, I used to be an OPTIMIST, now I'm evil and like pain
very bad    for me
Actually that one commenting on my "loser" was really mean, I don't like    you, im thinking maybe I SHOULD have flamed you
yeah, definitely     If nothing else, I could at least have
uh
online six pack jocking    stuff going on
Well, actually, on the internet, everyones a bully, unless you don't want    to be
but theres very few people with actual self control
The other ones were funny
really     That whole thing chain on me not being original made me smile     It was fun for a while     But now the problem is
you made lots of MEAN people come going around    leaving anonymous insults
I've heard of secret Santa, and secret admirer
but never
no actually    the whole secret insulter thing was on Calvin and Hobbes once, so its not    that new     Well, despite all that, you have to admit you went a tad too far calling    people pimple headed, and such, calling people losers, and making fun of    ideas that
as once Maddie pointed out
hey, wait a minute, now its    gone
well the point is that I copy stuff from other people, use mixes of    writing styles, and of course, being all emotional and such as I am
about half of whatever current ideas I have are based on what recently    happened and how I feel at that exact moment
See, but at least I freely admit it, and said sorry, many, many times     And, because of all that, I can guilt-free laugh my head off at all of it    and look like im high     Just wondering
to everyone out there, how many of you think im high,    like, constantly     Annnnnnyway, back to the subject     I think the nice, AND hilarious thing to do right now would be use that    outrageously bored mind of yours, write something witty, APOLOGETIC, and    flame me ONE LAST TIME, and then disappear forever, or just reveal your    identity, and be like one big happy online family     Or, ill just switch most of my entries to friends only, which I wouldn't    like at all     Just think about it for a while- jeff     PS
that was freaking hilarious if you think about it</lj-cut>     These have just been sitting on my computer for a while     i didnt have much to do with them
they werent very good in my    opinion
whatever

Jeffrey63090 [11:04 PM]: doesnt it startle you how sometimes other people    are just like you     Jeffrey63090 [11:05 PM]: not really me to you but other people like tom or    freddy     Jeffrey63090 [11:05 PM]: i didnt get to know freddy that much but you    could tell he was just like me     BOOMER2005 [11:06 PM]: are you comparing me to them

Do You know what
Date: 7/16/2003 3:12:33 PM Eastern Standard Time     From: Jeffrey63090     To: ZigZag0711     ugly meenie head     they didn'lt work for me but i thought i could send them to u and laugh
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha     ha     (this was after i forwarded a bunch of junk mail)     Subj: Re: ha ha ha     Date: 7/17/2003 6:29:19 PM Eastern Standard Time     From: Jeffrey63090     To: ZigZag0711     In a message dated 7/16/2003 4:34:48 PM Eastern Standard Time, ZigZag0711    writes:     ~AlEXxon     ~AlEXxon
what is al exxon     (umm i forget what this is all about)     dear alex xon     u are ugly and keep mailing me     i dont know his sn     i have to talk to tsquared (tarik) now     good day     (this was later the same day as the previous entry but i didnt quite    finish reading my mail
com     sn and email respectivley     respectively means in that order ie
aussiekid90 is sn and yuwenli is    email     tarik told me and says willie dispises all forms of life in conn
now i remember
the weird stuff was about him not knowing the screen name    of friends and my unknowing the answers     hey moo ron     of course i got it but i noted that your name is inside alexxon     also im in nj and we have a yard about 2 times bigger than your entire lot     thats because we have both a well and a septic so we have to have one in    front and one in back with a set distance in between so there is no chance    of drinking your own waste to put it neatly     life is pretty good here considering going to the mailbox takes a full 1    minute and 15 seconds - call me lazy but thats pretty far     i hope things are cool in summer fine arts, unless that has aready    finished but im sure u would be glad because some people are actually    better than your private teacher coolness and such but then there is the    whole matter of my non existance and of mike Dee's     existance i mean     anyway its hard to figure life from another since i thought i was a very    different person than everyone but have within the last year made several    startling discoveries of similarities starting with u then matt then the    other matt then the fabled freddy and then the person i met at camp    rodney
also in the jumble was maggie and greg who seemed to break away    the illusion of simplicity that i noticed we all have and turned out to be    like staring at myself
then again there are so many people that just pop out thoughout the years    and are just like you much to your amazement     whats cool is to think or know or think you know or think you know you    just are thinking - that they are just as surprized at you
this is great stuff for bored like me huh
basicly i hope you can sift through all this jumble like i know, or think    or think i know and so on,and get down to the point which i will not    proof-read to make sure is there
good luck and check if i used sift right    if it is actually a word
this is me blabbing on and on don't mind it if you cant understand
you    arent supposed to be able to     After sitting through your most intrigueing and mind bobbling moronic    document, i have concluded that your "bored like me" is going to bomb
You    possibly probably thought that perhaps i would say that your "bored like    me" would boom in the nearby future
Have you noticed that "boom" and    bomb" are not the same in grammar terms but are war time terminalogies
Amazing
anyway i'm sick and miserable
Sad but    true
If you want to write another book, write " SICK IN THE SUMMER
huh
I'm one of the few people who are sick in the summer
Speaking of books, i have been reading the DRAGONLANCE series
these books    are pretty good
Not darn good
not sure good
But pretty good
After    reading that hitchhikers trilogy
My mind has been less swelling
On to    summer fine arts
well right now it's 2 days to the end of SFA
I got to    skip today
And I AM BETTER THAN michel DEE
our shirts are gayer than    last year
but you liked last years shirt
so i would put you in the    category of -----
I can't say the word i was going to say because that would offend you
Anyway the shirt has maroon letters you moo ron
and baby blue shirt    itself
this SFA has been h*ll
We are playing HARRY    POTTER
don't worry, i'm not going to faint
i already    did 7 times
I have to delouse myself now
talk to you later
ALEX     this is the smart side of a near copy of myself, which is, as you should    know, a guy who acts odd and generally stupid     _________________________________________________________     _________________________________________________________     this is the end of the long boringness
Its the end of the vote section    too
End of November 2008     I dreamt the world ended
It was a very long dream
When I woke up, I was    disappointed to see the ground
It has it's own note
When I look up into your eyes, I    see the stars
I, the time traveler, am shorter than everyone else, who    I find quite beautiful
When someone asks me what it's like to be    decidedly worse than everyone else, I reply with a smile rather than a    frown
You know what really bothers me
During the winter, because it's cold, and    stuff, the sky is always really clear, so it's perfect for stargazing
But    it's also really cold, and therefore completely terrible for stargazing
It sucks
It really bothers me
I think I've been conditioned to fall asleep every time I dream
That's because to dream you have to be asleep
No you don't
When falling asleep in a place with lots of noise/etc, I watch them twist    and distort into a dream
and I follow the dream down into sleep
Maybe its just because I'm not religious, but I always assumed it wasn't    "believe" as much as
Do some people really think that cows are holy
The point of literature is to convey an idea or emotion
I was trying to convince Luke that "The Catcher In the Rye" was a good    book, despite his personal hatred of it
Just as not everyone likes    Shakespear, but he is undisputably a good writer, we should be able to say    that Catcher is good because of the very reason that people to tend to    hate it: it's slow, depressing, nonsensical, random
It's a perfect    demonstration of what it means to be depressed, insane, or a messed up    teenager

In grade school, in days
Now,    in weeks
And when I'm older

So strange
Where does it all go
Saturday 12/20/08     At 11:45     Sometimes, being a smartass is ESPECIALLY obnoxious
For example, if you're buying something, sometimes the clerk will say    "buying this
7/27/09     Vincent's Birthday, and also me and Elise broke up
We went to Owen's, where I flirted heavily with Owen, and told Elise to do    the same
She didn't
I had about a million puns on being gay
So let me see how it is     Apparently,     It is NOT that the word interesting is inherently biased towards what    humans find interesting
When we see a dull scene, there is nothing to it
But if an alien saw it, it is very interesting
So then, they would say, "the emotion I feel, in terms you understand,    toward this scene, are best described as interesting"     And you would say "oh
I don't get it, but I'll tell you more, if you'd    like"     And the alien would say "oh, that's very kind of you
Please do"     Owen disproved that interesting is a biased word
This fixes a lot of    things I didn't get before, but have now forgotten
This was an important conversation

that maybe im normal    Jeffrey63090 [9:20 PM]:   lol    Jeffrey63090 [9:20 PM]:   strange    indescisivegrl [9:20 PM]:   it is    indescisivegrl [9:20 PM]:   if you're normal    indescisivegrl [9:20 PM]:   then i must be like    Jeffrey63090 [9:21 PM]:   not
Jeffrey63090 [9:21 PM]:   weird huh
indescisivegrl [9:21 PM]:   *shivers* i don't even want to think about    that    indescisivegrl [9:21 PM]:   it's odd to think about it    indescisivegrl [9:22 PM]:   becasue i always believed that normality like    i said is opinionated    indescisivegrl [9:22 PM]:   but there actually is a set normality    Jeffrey63090 [9:22 PM]:   i wonder if normal people write stuff to vent    emotion
indescisivegrl [9:22 PM]:   maybe    Jeffrey63090 [9:22 PM]:   because
it looks to me like everyone does it    now    indescisivegrl [9:23 PM]:   apparently people use different ways to vent    like me today i balsted the radio and i layed on the floor and cried    Jeffrey63090 [9:23 PM]:   did you lock the room
indescisivegrl [9:23 PM]:   yeah but my lock is messed up    Jeffrey63090 [9:23 PM]:   i dont have a lock    indescisivegrl [9:23 PM]:   so it wouldn't matter    Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   i dont need it usually anyway    indescisivegrl [9:24 PM]:   yeah    indescisivegrl [9:24 PM]:   well i do    indescisivegrl [9:24 PM]:   with my lil sis's    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   hah, mine are sort of like me, they just wonder    around as they please    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   but sometimes i accidentally put things in thier    rooms    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   and i touch things and get them messed up    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   so they have locks    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   i dont care usually     indescisivegrl [9:26 PM]:   ohhh well so do my sisters even though the    shrink told my mom to get a lock for my room she never did    Jeffrey63090 [9:26 PM]:   yeah, but then you'd have that one possibility,    of just locking the room and never coming out    Jeffrey63090 [9:26 PM]:   and thats usually a bad thing    Jeffrey63090 [9:26 PM]:   to have that choice    indescisivegrl [9:27 PM]:   yeah i sometimes go out of my window and dance    in the rain
but i always come back i'm a good girl    Jeffrey63090 [9:27 PM]:   its like having the choice to hang yourself
you might just use it one day, so its better not to have it there at all    indescisivegrl [9:27 PM]:   true    Jeffrey63090 [9:27 PM]:   a little bit of knowledge can be a bad thing    indescisivegrl [9:28 PM]:   yeah it really can    Jeffrey63090 [9:28 PM]:   lol (the speed of light is faster than the speed    of sound, so i'll have to scream so my lips move at the same time as you    hear me)    Jeffrey63090 [9:29 PM]:   i think thats funny    indescisivegrl [9:29 PM]:   i don't get it    indescisivegrl [9:29 PM]:   but i'm slow    indescisivegrl [9:29 PM]:   so don't explain    Jeffrey63090 [9:29 PM]:   it doesnt make sense really, but thats why its    funny    indescisivegrl [9:29 PM]:   oh okay then    indescisivegrl [9:31 PM]:   that's odd    Jeffrey63090 [9:31 PM]:   that its funny becaus its dumb
Jeffrey63090 [9:31 PM]:   think about it
indescisivegrl [9:31 PM]:   yeah    Jeffrey63090 [9:31 PM]:   what ISNT funny because its dumb    indescisivegrl [9:32 PM]:   ummm uber corny stuff    indescisivegrl [9:32 PM]:   i can think of like a hundred    Jeffrey63090 [9:33 PM]:   but corny is funny to some people    indescisivegrl [9:33 PM]:   the key word there is SOME people not everyone    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   the key word there is SOME people    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   duhhhhhhhhhh    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   lol    indescisivegrl [9:34 PM]:   leave me alone    indescisivegrl [9:34 PM]:   just because i'm stupid    indescisivegrl [9:34 PM]:   doesn't mean you can make fun of me    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   theres a reason for that    indescisivegrl [9:34 PM]:   wait what
Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   its just very mean    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   so i wont say it    indescisivegrl [9:35 PM]:   no i'm confused so finish your thought    Jeffrey63090 [9:35 PM]:   no i think it wont be very clear anyway    indescisivegrl [9:35 PM]:   i'm so easily confused
Jeffrey63090 [9:35 PM]:   see, because its one of those philisophical    things    indescisivegrl [9:35 PM]:   so    Jeffrey63090 [9:36 PM]:   since its social behavior, it doesnt have to be    smart, or even make sense    Jeffrey63090 [9:36 PM]:   it just has to be    indescisivegrl [9:36 PM]:   be what speaking of social behavior
Happy    coming out day    Jeffrey63090 [9:36 PM]:   lol    Jeffrey63090 [9:36 PM]:   ok    indescisivegrl [9:36 PM]:   even though it's almost over    Jeffrey63090 [9:36 PM]:   i wore a ribbon    Jeffrey63090 [9:36 PM]:   did you    indescisivegrl [9:36 PM]:   it still is awesome i am still wearing my    ribbon    Jeffrey63090 [9:37 PM]:   i took mine off    Jeffrey63090 [9:37 PM]:   lol    indescisivegrl [9:37 PM]:   ohhh well    Jeffrey63090 [9:37 PM]:   people were conspiring to put a bunch on me    Jeffrey63090 [9:37 PM]:   but i was already wearing one     indescisivegrl [9:37 PM]:   that's soooo mean    Jeffrey63090 [9:37 PM]:   so they didnt    Jeffrey63090 [9:37 PM]:   no its just funny    indescisivegrl [9:38 PM]:   w/e    indescisivegrl [9:38 PM]:   i'm too sensitive
i think everythings mean    Jeffrey63090 [9:38 PM]:   well    Jeffrey63090 [9:38 PM]:   it is mean    Jeffrey63090 [9:38 PM]:   but its still funny    indescisivegrl [9:38 PM]:   i don't think so
but i'm one of those    people    Jeffrey63090 [9:38 PM]:   who dont enjoy satire
indescisivegrl [9:39 PM]:   maybe    Jeffrey63090 [9:39 PM]:   or slapjack humor

i gotta go like now
Jeffrey63090 [10:21 PM]:   bye
Sometimes I shock myself with the goofy ideas my brain comes up with
Well, actually, I usually have the idea, think of it seriously, and then    in hindsight realize that it was a stupid idea in the first place, and    wonder why I would ever consider it
It all started when you first made your heartfelt confession
At the time    I just thought of you as "that person we give rides to" (yes
that's    all)     (hey
darn it
The irony of this is really pathetic
this is    turning out to be a really goofy idea
I'm shocked
I had developed a bit of a liking to you and after that note, those    feelings just seemed to explode
I found myself thinking of nearly nothing    but you and that little note
So what was I supposed to do
I got up and put forth my first idiotic    idea: use lies to get the truth
I did that a lot throughout our    relationship, and this was the first one
I'm touched
Really
Basically, the amount of    emotion flowing in anger and annoyance were directly proportional to    LOVE
I also did the same thing by making you pay for my movie ticket
brilliant plan
was to deny you of any sort of pleasures from    me
This one I regret the most, because you still do it
Sometimes, whenever I    catch myself feeling a bit down that you don't want me (or at least show    it) I remind myself that I show pretty much no wanting at all toward you,    and that its probably my fault anyway
I bet you blame yourself in the same way
funny no
So to carry out this second plan of denial, the first act was purely    accidental
At "The Grudge" you offered your hand
I refused to take it A)    because mine was all sweaty and disgusting and B) because it was like
the first date
Yeah     Also I made a disagreeable habit of ditching you whenever you asked "Can I    have a hug
yeah     But now, its
like backwards
Instead of planning to not let you have    even the slightest clue of what's going on in my head, its like I'm    throwing everything out there, trying to desperately fix something that I    really don't see anything broken with
Somehow, I feel like now you're the one leading me around with my own    emotions as a leash
I don't exactly like knowing that I'm at the mercy of    my emotions, which are endlessly toyed with by someone else
Take me somewhere safe Marissa     OHHHHHHHHH Yeah
The reason I STARTED writing this, and then got a bit distracted is that    my body somehow got the idea that I should kiss you
for some odd    reason
weird isn't it
It must be hard being a girl with a shy boyfriend     Don't blush
Did it work
It was mostly just a really fun game that I played
I think I've been    doing it pretty much all through my entire life
See how far the world can    bend before something breaks
Well, see I was leaning toward the emotional    side
but it got kinda unstable when you stared leaning toward the    physical side
If we look back that was sorta
today, one year ago
Hey, that's    funny
wait
no its not, but I'm still laughing
Anyway, I hope you had a lot of fun with me and have a lot of fun with    Cael     Hopefully you'll remember me always as the one who liked hugs
or    something catchy like that
Yeah, and if you ever need it, I made you a little coupon once
You can    just pretend yesterday never happened if you want
Oh and I worked out something fun, but I sort of promised I wouldn't print    it out
Whachimafoo-it
You know that thing
whats it called
Right
Cael
I think its only fair that he gives me piggy back rides
AND doesn't make out with you in the halls
cuz that's seriously    disturbing
Everything's all better
I feel this way about a lot of people
A mix between avoidance,    insignificance and fear of hypocracy
How can some people not realize that their smiles make my day
How could they miss that I feel so small, helpless, ugly, and stupid by    comparision
Do they never realize that to me, they walk on clouds
Or that their    beauty shines perpetually in my mind
Have they ever stopped to wonder why    I can't talk when I'm around them
Do they ever have a clue that to me,    they're perfect
And me
Nobody thinks this of me
Or, is that the same thing the Hallway Goddesses think
Long Hair makes many thoughts     5/18/09     If someone were to ask me why I have such long hair, one reason that    easily could be my reason, but is not, is that long hair causes me to    think more than I normally do
This is especially true in regard to my    ability to dream, and explore thoughts in a visual way
The long hair, however, seems also to be a primary source of my inability    to sleep very well recently, though I think it is more of a correlation,    rather than of causation
Here are two examples of where I think it is accurate to have the    contradiction of what I really think is the reason placed side by side    with what is truly the reason
Possibly three
Now I've lost them
The point is that there is something interesting about all this
Take for    example, this scenario
you're not superior
Why
Because Dualism sucks, and I hate it
Complicates my life, and I don't really want to learn enough about it to    be able to eliminate these problems
I have the sense that learning more    about Dualism will only lead to more of these kinds of thoughts
For example: in the car today, coming back from seeing Star Trek in IMAX,    I asked Amanda about how she would rate herself on the girliness scale,    where 10 is someone who thinks of everything in the most cutesy, romantic    terms imaginable, to a sickening level
She seems to be approximately a 5
She wanted to know why I wanted to know, but I didn't tell her
Now that I think about it, there are only four serious reasons, given the    information that I stopped my line of thought after her response
One, I    was simply curious or bored
Two and Three are opposites of each other
Either I wanted advice from a girl on how to proceed without being too    cutesy, but her frame of reference didn't match with the girl I'm looking    to woo, or it did, and I am now too shy
The fourth is similar: I was    thinking of us together, and wanted to know whether or not we were    compatible
For the record, it was for advice on whether it's a good idea or not to    write an awesome letter, but then we would get dragged into details about    the girl, and about my writing ability, and all sorts of things that would    really bother me
So, not exactly "too shy"
More like, the beginning    assumption for figuring out my motives tended to assume that I either    thought my plan through all the way, or that I was very simply curious
I    suppose if "too shy" was modified to "reconsidered asking advice" then we    can simplify to only three cases, but would have to remove the dependence    on the information she gave about herself
That's a bit too broad for    comfort
The other thoughts:     I've been waking up really early recently
The reason
Dreams
Many of them
I've learned how to dispel them
They    may become immune to my method of dispellation, and also, I may tend to    attempt to dispel real life if this continues
Both of these are absolutely fascinating outcomes that I would actually    really want to see
Like I was telling Owen, and myself, and Hanna (though in each different    ways), I forsee problems with my type of thinking
I am a radical, who is    waiting to find his cause
I am too scientific for my own good: too    focused on whether or not I CAN, before considering whether or not I    SHOULD
Whatever it is, this type of insanity is captivating, and I think    I do wish to cultivate it
But not artificially
I wish to be TRULY    insane, rather than become convinced that I am
Is there a difference (here, again, I am confusing the true cause with    possible causes)
Causality within the mind
bothers me
The other one:     In an attempt to get a kiss:     I
I miss everything about you
I miss the way you look
You get a little closer to take a good look at her, taking care to look    deep in her eyes
I miss the way you feel
You take her by the hands, and get even closer
I miss the way you smell
Give her a bit of a hug, and sigh with pleasure
Take this opportunity to judge how well things are going
If things are going EXCELLENT:     Insert "I miss the way you sound"     (whisper gently in her ear
I miss the way you taste
And, if all goes well, this is where you get an awesome kiss
If it doesn't then try to salvage things with
I still missed the way you    sound
in the end, im just talking when nobody's there, and bragging about my    guilt when they are, just like now     whats that
see, read it again    im trying to STOP but when i did, i realized i NEVER said i was sorry
so what do i do, i "cleverly" cover it up as if i had NO CARE in the world    , and be like, "it would really suck if people still talked about it" and    then just apologize in the middle of the sentance, make sure everything    was sort of alright, and let you get back to your business     then go decide to flame me, and tell my not so secret, secret of me    copying other writers, and happily skip off
all im saying, is that i really tried to turn these crunchy, hard, shelled    peanuts into butter, even the chunky kind
i didn't expect smoothness, but i had no idea that george washington    carver would slap me over the head either
Hotness meter and average cuteness
This scene takes place in Calc class, Tuesday, March 11, 2008, one day    after the first day of spring track
What's up
What are you doing next    Thursday when you're SUPPOSED to be at practice
You're driving me to Rita's, for free water ice
Ouch
YOU weren't there
and YOU weren't there" pointing to both    of them
sorry
Was it really hard
But there's a serious deficiency of cute girls
Anna
What's your    problem
how is that my fault
There's practically nobody cute on    the team left
Why the hell am I still on it
Anna, you need to join the team RIGHT NOW
I    need you to hold me over until Sasha comes back from Spain, and then you    can quit again
No thanks
You should join the track team
That'd be even better"     "Um
No thanks
it's just
um
True
Even Trevor knows Amanda's hot
This thought    should be abolished
lets return to the actual plot
Who's Sasha"     "Only the cutest person ever
Having her on the team would multiply the    average cuteness by at LEAST 10x
Ok
Every single person is a 9/10 and we    have like 100 people on the team
Both of these are gross exaggerations    (or
more accurately, Cute exaggerations)
So we have a total of 900    cute points
Then, Sasha comes in, and replaces some quitter
Sasha's cuteness is
OVER NINE THOUSANDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
So now we have at least 10 times more in the numerator, considering our    ridiculous base assumptions, and the same denominator
You can sit down now
I think about everything
The more I think about it, the more I realize that the best way to    characterize the way I think is by "slowly
and not in words"
Physics and Calc have a tendency to hum in the back of my mind when I'm    doing
whatever
What's in the front is usually girls, people, and    chess
Spanish floats around randomly, and magic as a general rule is    omnipresent
This scene takes place in the Media center after Marissa randomly asks me    if I can tell her what her best feature is
Wait
I mean
No
They're really nice
And it's true
It's actually kind of hard for boobs not    to be a good feature
I guess the next best thing would be your belly
But you're not,    like, fat or anything
It's just
very attractive
Every time I felt it,    it was like `ooooh
was the hair"     "I hate my hair" - something most girls I know seem to say a lot, Marissa    being no different in this way
It always smelled good
And it's pretty
What else does    hair need
ummm
Think of this beforehand
sort of
Remember
its not that    unusual
Just
things
You know
It just
happens
I'm sure it happens to her sometimes    too, its just one of those things that will never be said
except for on    top of a rooftop in my dreams
Conversations about things I always want to    say have a habit of happening on rooftops and in doorways
Places that are    always lonely in the real world
Don't read this
Hey, I wrote a story on this yesterday
and it's perfectly applicable to    the situation going on right now
Wanna see
and why would you tell me that
You know I'm going to    want to look now
And, it's about a
of the way down
and I've only ever    seen
way down
AND so, after a long chat with my parents, on this day, November 3rd 2004,    it was brought to my attention, that sometimes we lead ourselves into a    fool's paradise
Sometimes I just want to be loved so much that I would go    to the greatest extremes
I remember last time- Christine
or something,    I cant quite recall
or at least the spelling
That was quite an    episode
But never lasted     I don't want that to happen again
I wish I could stop it, but I know that    it will happen, so I tried to just ignore it all, and leave it be
But I    couldn't
I couldn't, you can't stop thinking
Its like the ring
It only goes away    when you pass it on, make a copy
Like Romeo- such a stupid story
Dumb    fool gets all weaved up- hopefully I'm not stupid enough to kill myself    for something that's not even true
Things never work out these ways
I wish I could be good, or at least    better
Good enough not to screw myself at the very least
Dumb self    falling in love and such
I hate it
One of the worse parts of being    human- can't even show the least bit of self control
Kind of sucks
The only way I can possibly save myself it to give into something that    seems to slowly disappear, and be left broken at the end
Or
too late    now, but ignore it
fight the emotions
Then, I always find myself    fighting something unconquerable, but always seems to just get bored of    fighting, and leave
It just picks up and leaves in the middle of a fight
The only thing that    would ever work- is to lie
Fake it when its gone- maybe it'll come back,    maybe it wont, but at least you don't hurt anyone
Or, maybe you'll hurt    them more
I don't know, who does anyway
I don't want to hurt her
Its only fun when    you don't care
I just care too much sometimes
I don't show it- but all    those people talking behind my back are what scare me most
At least, I    can acknowledge that they have something good to talk about, and leave    while they stare off in my general direction
Maybe im just exaggerating
There's too much to tell, there's no way to tell it
I'm tired of living    with the doubt
My only way of getting out of it is to lie
Lie and lie    and lie
Lie because I don't see the truth
Its somewhere, probably right    in front of me
somewhere even closer maybe
But I cant see it, I cant feel it, and no matter how much I look, I never    seem to find it in time
Time is a funny thing, I used to have so much to    say about it
Now none of that counts it seems, maybe its because I already said it
it    needs to be told anyway, but now the words are spent- empty
It always    feels that way
Every telling gets shorter and shorter, and more muddled
I tried to tell the story of who's done everything; how it all happened
There was no having it
I couldn't remember when it all started
All I    remember was that Ben sent me to find her
there was lots of talking and    general fooling around on my part, and suddenly things happened
The    letter- more of a note actually, the bus, Kevin- who now knows only half-    but is more clearly seeing things than I am, there were my note, totally    overlooked-covered over with lies, and fancy maneuvering
And of course, lots of thinking, followed shortly by MORE letters and    finally monica's party
suddenly things of the mind came out in the world,    only all twisted and turned around, and when it got quiet enough for me to    think, when I finally stopped shouting "that's not what I meant", I    finally found
maybe it was
I got all confused- again
Suddenly things took over me and I couldn't    even think
Lots of things happened at once, and I find myself NOT    thinking of her, and asking her out anyway
That's not how its supposed to    happen
That's just wrong     And suddenly the PERFECTLY wrong thing happens, people know
That's the only thing I wanted for certain to happen, because that's what    kept getting me confused
I wish they would stop talking
The truth is that I didn't want all of it
I was confused, I don't know    what to do
I cant deal with my emotions, they rule me
They bring me to    pieces
Frustration, anger, happiness
Its so much easier to deal with    them as just imaginary things, that you don't have to worry about
But    when they come to life, and bring you to you knees screaming "NO NO NO,    that's all wrong" then theres nothing you can do
I guess I fear them in a way, being so powerful
An ounce of emotion could be more explosive than a ton of any other    material
There's not enough time
I cant work hard enough ever, something's always    going to slip through the cracks
But, what if all the precious gold is    kept, while panning out other insignificant idea
To this I say a favorite quote of mine
It goes something like this: "the    moment one pays the slightest bit of attention to the most insignificant    detail, it becomes a magnificent, stunningly awesome world in itself"     Here it is:  The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a    blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably    magnificent world in itself
It's a good one, by Henry Miller
There's an immense world around us
Cross country made me see this
Have you ever ran 7 miles
It takes about    an hour, going at a decent speed
And looking on a map
insignificant
Congratulations, the distance you covered is about a pinprick on a world    map
Good going Disney, it's a small world after all, if your legs are hundreds    of miles long
Imagine being a cute furry rodent- crossing a field is like    cutting through a mile of jungle, where things look to eat you
A car- just some giant whomping death machine, you never see it coming
And if you do, you might just die of a heart attack the next day
Good job, being wusses made us the dumbest "intelligent" life there ever    was
If you look closely, that last sentence sums up this entire thing, maybe    even my whole life

The freshman stories     3/9/06     well, after track one day, a bunch of us were just sitting around     and I was either complaining
or thinking that I was too tired to    complain
about how tired I was
Well, luck has it that a nice girl comes by and asks "does anyone here    know how to get to room 405
I'll take you there
That didn't happen, so don't    worry about me getting my face beat in
As we stroll down together, I sort of set a speedy pace, and as we pass    the office, (from where Marissa was watching me the whole time) I look    back and give everyone a thumbs up
I also give them a "YES" face
With    tongue
She stares practically right at me as I turn
I think "
ass" because clearly, that's what I am
Well, we stroll down the hallway, and I notice the sudden absence of    conversation
Well, that can be fixed
except that I kind of feel    awkward with this person I don't know, who probably already hates me
So naturally the first thing to do is to make it so I know her
No name, nothing
And
I think the only thing she learned about me is that I'm an ass, I    like freshmen because everyone else is basically dead and boring, and that    I know where room 405 is
Maybe a name
I'm not sure about that one
Oh, and she might think I think she's stupid
because to break the    silence I pointed out the "400 hall" sign
it's the 400 hall
get    it
Stupid powerwalking
Honestly, she could slow down
Well, anyways, I came back, and everyone laughed at me
Marissa asked    "how's your freshman buddy
I feel like    bringing up that I got her when she was a freshman, but I kind of wanted    to be with her, so we could hold that down
The peanut gallery hoots with    laughter
Jared suddenly realizes what happened
holds it in for all of ten    seconds
I guess my timing was a bit off this time
No    surprise
Xkcd     Everyone loves this, because it's great     Dresden codak     I liked this because it was good

Why am I writing this, when I quite clearly don't have the time
because if I don't I'm quite clearly going to go insane
I don't feel like I even have enough time to think
I really wish things would sort themselves out too
I am losing the ability to handle anything
I freak out a lot
I used to know that usually me freaking out was just an    act (well most of the time
Lunchtable with Amanda saying "you're a lot    better when you just sit there and smile" was a veritable meltdown
Well, now I flip out and stuff and its bad
Apparently its also affecting my ability to put ideas down onto paper
I also get those mini attacks a lot more often     Awkward moments DO define my life now
I wish I could just put down the    details right now, but think gym (walking across empty spaces, running    alone, not being close to anyone, the "beat up" shirt and mannerisms    episode
and think spainish class
Think being alone all the time
Girls
oh well     Think of music, slowly taking over my life, so I can't think
Dickens is a bastard, what a shitface     swearing a lot, feeling like threatening everyone, attacking everyone
just wanting to escape     sleep deprivation because sitting alone staring at nothing is better than    what my life is right now
wanting to be with sarah, ups
and now more than usual, downs     maybe I'll never get things right
Trying to find someone to love and keep me sane
Was I only ever sane when    I had a girl to ruin mind     discovering that I actually have a REAL irrational fear
why did I feel so responsible for    Jared fucking with her
Why can't I be a good friend
Marty
Oh god
Ironman
Maybe he's part of the reason I'm pissy all the time
Part
Once you're in my heart, will you ever leave
Rosie sparks emotion
I spark uncomfortability
That was a good rant
it    was about "do you ever have someone who sort of gets you all screwed up on    the inside and you go absolutely insane
I actually felt    a lot better
BTW, stop being hot
it's distracting
Oh yeah, Rosie's lunch table needs to stop talking about boobs
Really
Sasha, I will never talk to you, and I will never have a good reason why    not

Wednesday 2:30 AM, September 24, 2008     So
you're a writer
Me-Well, more of a rememberer
Or not
Which is why I write
TO remember
Oh
Ok
Me-But
you know, the problem with writing
is that in order to access    the information, you have to read it
And if you're writing it all down,    then you have to spend hours and hours reading until you find what you're    looking for
But you have to do the same thing for when you're trying to remember    something
It's a lot faster, but you're searching for what you want
And    then you only get fragments anyway
You don't    remember most of the stuff until you need it
Its just that you search and    read automatically most of the time
Then you'd be crazy smart, right
Or    just confused
If that's your reality, I'm sure you'd learn to deal with it
Maybe that's    how the mind works already
We're filtering all the crap in the    background
Me-Mine doesn't
I don't remember anything, unless it's in the form of a    question
on a test
And then not even
it just sort of happens    sometimes
What are the implications
of if you remember everything all the time

Also, i kind of have to deal with you not being with me
lets see
every day
this is what i kept trying to say "you wouldn't get"     this is what i keep trying to tell EVERYONE who keeps asking why i'm so    weird all the time
The only thing is, that i cant
So, i'll just pretend    that im not
so
pretending that didn't happen isnt really an option right now
if i hadn't been so lazy, i could have put it nicer, but that's just how i    see it right now
hey
i just realized im being dumb     ummmmmmmmm yeah
just forget all that stuff above
the only thing that's    still there is "and yet, porter's entire class mocked my idea of just    pretending the past didn't happen
Fair
I can ignore,    like i've been doing for a really long time, but forget is another thing    altogether
ignoring something that i wrote, while telling    about ignoring
all while the thing im ignoring
is kinda about    avoiding the subject
which i do when going into a tangent about    forgetting
I'm too good at hiding
like a ninja)     I'm still not sure if i ever told anyone about this
but the thing about    this not going out thing
is that its about survival for me
I get this    feeling that if i dont make it throught this one little bit, then i'm    never going to be able to do anything
Like, if i dont do this, i'm    doomed
then again, after watching rent, something completely contradictory comes    to mind
its very strange
and i don't really want to hold you back
I really tried to let you go    with Jared, but i guess you're not into that thing
I found it    astonishingly easy to fake my way and pretend that i didn't care anymore
i guess that's what i get from all that practice
I'm really set on making it to June
but you know what you said
that your handy "dump Jeffrey" magic 8 ball would    be
well, Handy
then, we can see if we're destined to be together     that would be so much fun     "imagine me and you, i do,     its only right to think about     the girl you love, to hold her tight     imagine how the world could be     so very fine
so happy togetherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I cant see me lovin' no body but u     for all my lifffeeeeeeeeeeeee     when you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue     for all my lifeeeeeeeeeeee           me and u     and u and me     no matter how they toss the dice
it had to be     the only one for me is u     and u for me     so happy togetherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
but SOMEONE here
thinks that they eight ball is ALWAYS right
and    when it says "dump" you have to do it
haha     jk     wait
is that me or you
annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd     most of that bitch vs bitch vs bitch
was just a random story
its basically what i was getting at a LOOOONG time ago in Porter's class
so dont feel bad
and thanks for making sure i didn't feel
well ripped from limb to limb    due to some internet flaming that you (thankfully) withheld
i think i did this once before and the person got UBER    pissed
i have a very vauge feeling that i've written that exact same    thing before
PLEASE dont be angry at it
its seriously meant to try    and fix things
also
i need to know the difference between when people will be able to    tell if im just kidding
and when they'll be PISSED     i mean seriously
this is like the 20th time this year
and im getting    WORSE every day
someone help me
on the plus side, i've learned how to apologize, which i wrote about 4/5    of a story on
who knows if its ever going to be finished     and
hopefully if it does get finished it hides for a long time
until it wont hurt anyone anymore     its not good
Point of View     So it all happened today
Or more accurately, it all started when I    started liking girls
For the longest time I had this fling with this one    girl
Wait
wrong story
This story happens to be with the next actual crush I had
It was with    Emily Something-or-other
She was in my class for only one year, and she    was in my swim team
It was pretty sad, because A) I was like
chunky    back then and B) she really hated me
That and she was going out with this    one little punk who always talked about beating people up when even I    could've taken him
That and everyone was pretty sure he was gay
Not only    did Emily completely hate me, but she wanted to kill me
This wasn't
wait
yeah it was completely my fault
I really should have learned to    keep my mouth shut around her because anytime I even joked around a    little, she would threaten my life
and she seemed pretty ready to do    it
Yeah
and that one time I said that it would be interesting to see a    gay guy go out with a tomboy
she REALLY didn't like that
So now we see
not only do I have major issues with communicating my    thoughts carefully, but we also see
tomboys
BTW Emily was pretty disgusting looking
I am not that shallow that looks    are the only thing that I care about
They're just something that happens    to people and everyone around them can see
And Marissa being REALLY hot    is just a coincidence
I swear
I once knew a Meg Thomas, but nobody here will know who she is
My best    friend at the time said "Dude, that's gross
rhythmically challenged drummer and overall was    rather decent looking
She wore casual wear and looked kinda like a guy
This was the source of the "Dude, that's gross
I donno if she was like
hot hot, but I thought she was pretty hot
I usually saw her wearing loose fitting khakis and she alternated between    tight shirts that accentuated her awesome body, or baggy shorts or pants    that furthered her boyish figure
I remember seeing her hang out in front    of the school before a dance, the same as I usually do
I asked Chase if    that was a boy or a girl
because he or she was pretty attractive the    way Meg was standing
She leaned against the wall as if she were someone    who just belonged there
It was as if she were part of the background to    everyone else, but I was the only one who could see her
It was the sort    of stance that established belonging no matter what the world thought
I    thought it was pretty cool and that Meg was a rather interesting    character
It made me wonder what kind of a person she was
So I asked a few friends about if she were really as cool as she looked    and apparently she was one of those people who are just bursting with    personality
Unfortunately they all agreed that I didn't have a chance    with her
So for the rest of the year I argued with my best friend on    whether or not she was hot, talked with her a bit, and made a rather funny    joke when she called me and Alex losers
Alex was that best friend
Today, lunch started the same as every other day, except I was    particularly excited about it being a completely fake day
It was
sorta like going to school to find out what your homework was and see some    friends before going on vacation
As I walked in, I predicted that    finally, today was the day that Someone would ask me why I was so late to    lunch
I made this prediction almost every day
Today, it happened, but I sort of gave one of those "I'm in a hurry" looks    and gave my voice the same tone
It worked rather well, and I slipped on    by with just a wave of my hand and "I was walking
They    were probably making fun of me, but didn't care enough to either stop me    or use this poking fun to lead up to a warning of being on time
I dropped my things heavily onto the Bench and proceeded to buy my lunch
Abby waved to me and I saw her converging with my path to the line
so I    feigned looking at the ceiling and cut her off when our paths met
I had a    good laugh playfully pushing her to the side and she sighed, smiled and    hopped in front of me going into the food
area
what is that thing    called anyway
Ordinarily it is a sloppy group of lines, but today
this area was a    crazy mash of people facing every direction imaginable
Some of them WERE    seriously looking up at the ceiling
I have no idea what was going on    but I shoved my way to the daily special line
On the way to the payment
bundle
I see Kevin and make another freshman buddy
Every    freshman needs a Sophomore buddy, and I like having all sorts of    buddies
Well
yeah, maybe I didn't make a freshman buddy because two seconds    later I forgot her name and had to ask Kevin "Whats that chick's name    again
that was a bad move
AMANDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I think
well
its Amanda's hair
wait
that's a guy
no
its Amanda
Hey Amanda's pretty hot like that
Wait
is that Amanda
I think so
its Amanda's hair
Is it Amanda
Hmm
I give it up and pretend to have not seen the hot man-manda
I regarded    this as a wise choice
unlike staying in the line with my freshman    buddies
they take too long and the line right next to us is empty
They    forget their pins so I just hop the line and go hit my code into the empty    line
AMANDAAAAAAAA
This time I actually say it
Soon we are in a heated debate over the meaning of calling people guys
Its rather difficult to explain to angry people that you don't know whats    going on but you do know that your not allowed to call people hot when    you're just friends
I hate you
And even though I know that I'll regret it later, and that I    have no real rational reason for hating you, it still doesn't change the    fact that at this very moment I do
There's a lot of things going through    my mind, and most of them are hurtful
I don't want that
I wish that    things were better, but they're not
Now I'm hurt, and I want to do the    same to you     1
On crying
I don't cry often
But for the past hour or so, that's been going through    my mind a lot
For some reason, you're making me remember many of my most    painful experiences in life
I hate myself for seeing things from too many    angles at once
I hate being able to see things from multiple    perspectives, because it makes me see that nobody is to blame, and that    isn't fair
I remember one time, falling down the stairs, and just crying    and crying at the bottom
Both my brothers showed up, and just stared at    me for a minute
I remember thinking that they were the worst people in    the world for not helping me
But now everything's different
I've been    both the ones at the top looking down- wishing I could do something to    help them out
I've been at the bottom, crying for help, but with nothing    but stares from onlookers
I've been the one who sees the whole thing and    says "well, you could just help them to their feet and let them sit at a    chair a while and cool off, not just leave them there
I've seen it from every angle
It's    hard to do that when you want to, and usually the information floods you    when you just want to have all your anger be fairly directed at whoever's    "to blame" like my brothers just now
It's not fair when you take that away from yourself
Its not fair when    there's nobody you can blame
It's not fair when you know that by    channeling that anger, your just causing more and more pain
I remember one time, when one of my best friends was about to leave
We    were playing at recess, and suddenly her dad, or brother or someone showed    up to play with her
It was the last time we would see each other, and I    remember I was so angry, and sad that she would rather be with them,    someone who she would see for the rest of her life, rather than me
I    don't remember if I cried or not, but I tried to hide my emotions, and    focus all my anger on who would count the least
Someone who wouldn't be    hurt by it
I threw sand and dirt in my face, out of anger and    frustration
Nobody was supposed to have noticed, but for the rest of the    day, everyone about it
Everyone thought I fell down or got in a fight or    something, but nobody really knew
I've often wondered if you ever cried because of me
I've even asked
I    still don't think I've gotten the right answer
Apparently, part of you    knew my intention, and saw right through the over-exaggerated care I put    on
I felt guilt over the possibility, but I wasn't as touched as I tried    to let on
2
On knowledge     I don't like it when somebody knows my business, and just gives it away    for free
I try to keep a lot of things inside, because that's what I've    learned from experience
Sometimes it's helpful to selectively leak things    out, and I do this often, but the great majority of things that I want    kept secret, stay secret
I've often tried to express this to myself in    words
It doesn't really make sense, but its like this
The more I have,    and the less I give, the better
It sounds so harsh like that but that's    how it is
I keep a lot of very minor things to myself, as does everyone,    but I feel like somehow I remember a lot more of them
Either that, or its    just that I feel guilty about it, and nobody else does
There are so many    little things that nobody could possibly know, but some of them I do
Half    the time, we'll be talking about something, and I'll suddenly remember one    of them, and have to really focus to keep anyone from knowing
Whenever    one of us mentions sleep, I remember a vague fuzzy dream that I had once
Whenever I'm near you, by body seems to call out to you and long for you,    but I feel like I have to restrain myself
Sometimes I feel like I    shouldn't because maybe one day I'll get so used to restraining myself    that I won't be able to express myself when I should
Sometimes I feel    like maybe I should do that because I can tell you're feeling the same    thing
10% of the time when I want to reach out and hold you, I have the    same sequence go on in my head
You turn    to me and say "What are you thinking," with a devilish grin
I wonder at how much you know, and how much I want you to know
Its like    I'm split between giving you everything and giving you nothing
3
What now
Now I feel all this anger and frustration
I feel like I cant trust you    with any more information, any more of my thoughts
I feel like not    talking to you
I feel like screaming out loud
I feel like punching the    wall
I feel like ignoring you
I feel like telling you that you can't    understand that you couldn't possibly
But I also see that you could, you probably do
You probably understand    perfectly
All the anger, all the frustration, you've gone through    probably before, and maybe right now
It's not fair that I cant blame you
I can't get this out of my head, but it's a simple example
I feel like I    did when I called you, but you weren't there
Each ring adds to the    tension, and fills you with thoughts of doubt
Finally, the machine comes    in, and you know, "they aren't home
You want to hunt them down and beat    them because they weren't there
I feel like that
I don't know if it works the same way    for kissing, but apparently all that denial burnt a hole straight through    your soul
One minute    you were there in my arms, the next on my lips
It happened too fast to    react
Next time
no going the whole 100% you horny
It's true, I admit it
But    at the same time, I know that however much you are my master in this, I am    just as much yours
Seeing things from many perspectives isn't all bad
Remember, it's only dirty if you Make it dirty
Everyone sniffed themselves and looked around
Sophie, always tactful, adds on
but everyone knows you're not done yet
more like
some really sweaty guy animal died in here
They smell like roses and perfume and stuff
we believe you
Sophie comes over and sniffs me
If anything, it was the shirt that smelled, so I throw in "well, the last    person who wore this shirt was a girl
so it can't be me"     Sophie's eyebrows raise
nothing
Fedor continues, "Why did you just call my house and say all those weird    things
Sophie's laughing
Marissa gives me an evil glare
You can tell by the way she decided to "joke"    about it
like this Saturday
I wish
there's this little conveyor belt thingie, and she just picks    the one she wants that day
and we needed some
backupdancers
I knew how her mind worked
She just laughed and laughed
and I wiggled out of the hole

Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     I've started writing again
A little while back i wanted to sort of get the whole summer     i mean everything important     Vincent at home     Kevin and Heidi     You being away (it was pretty tough on my end)     Your reallyyyyyy slow breakup with me     Summer practice (rosie=awkward, SASHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

more summer practice
and the world suddenly gets    complicated when school starts
thing is
how am i going to shove all that into a LONG thing
i mean
we all know i have a pretty short attention span
i mean
i didn't even get to 20 pages for YOU so
how am i going to do    it for me
but the thing is
i'm discovering i'm a pretttttty bad writer sometimes
I'm going to do this week
i have a page so far
If you want it, you    have to remember to ask     maybe i'll get lucky and you wont want it (that's the idea
so don't    feel guilty about not asking for it)
oh man
i just realized that this is a Catch 22 situation
if i leave out this last paragraph, then you'll be like "where is it
or    did he send this mail for nothing
you might feel guilty
i mean i would for at least    a minute or two
that's pretty goofy
well i have to practice
because i REALLY suck at band right now
and    for once our band teacher ACTUALLY cares
he has pretty high aspirations    for such a crappy conductor
You should see this guy
he's SO damn hard to follow
plus hes squarular looking and goofy in action
all at the same time
and sometimes he switches
whatever
i need to practice anyway (Laura makes fun of me a lot
and    wont give me hugs
what a tease
god :P)

I feel like
if I had become her best friend, my life would be a much    better place
They say: And
You haven't
No
They say: Why not
It's partly because we just didn't click
I think its mostly because
I'm selfish
They say: Really
Yes
She's made that abundantly clear
They say: That must've been tough
No, not really
She just has a way of making it very clear
and then made references that included "whining    like a little baby" or how I always want the attention
Not sure on exact    phrases
It was very good for me
I could use more of that
She's also very    interesting
Seems
fun

Current Events
There are some things I will never be comfortable with
I don't know why
I just won't
My reactions to deep personal questions goes back and forth    on this, but I'm currently in a "Dad, I don't want you to be involved in    my college applications because they will hold my personal thoughts
You can tell when he asks    "why not just do it already
It's because the prompt pulled out the way I think
It's    asking about why I'm best at a diverse campus, and my answer is that I    like to look at they way that other people think, and decide for myself to    mimic them or go a different way
I judge how best to handle problems by    looking at what my peers do, and comparing it to any way that I've been    thinking
Mostly, I don't want to show him "this is the way my mind works"    because
well, I just don't (I sort of feel like he would have some    advantage over me, or that he would mock me)
A while ago, I got very    defensive when he pushed me into doing the app
I got so worked up about    it, he started to care (only seen by the way his mood dramatically dropped    and became infuriated at something trial my mom did
not that this is    extremely unusual for him)
We went to Chili's today
I was sort of looking for a way to avoid it at    first
She recently broke up    with her boyfriend, whose name I feel guilty about forgetting
If I had    finished my app (an impossible task, seeing as I wanted to run it by    someone not blood-related to me), I would be free to visit her on campus,    which would be an infinitely less awkward, (hopefully) more comforting,    and more fun experience than talking to her over the phone
I've felt    weird around her since summer
Every now and then she would do or say    something that in almost any other person I would say "awesome
she    totally digs me
I'm very uncomfortable with even the idea    of Abby liking me
Even as a good friend, strangely
I also had the whole    mess of her dropping hints that she was seeing someone
When I said "some things I will never be comfortable with," this is one of    those things
Abby's relationships
I'm not certain why
If I    consider her being in a relationship a discomfort for me
I consider her    recent breakup something akin to the rack for me
Mentally, there's just    too much for me to handle
First of all, they were flirting throughout the    summer
and every time I heard his name, I knew she kind of liked him
My discomfort with the subject manifested into me looking away, closing my    mind to the thought, forgetting his name, and moving on
I chose to ignore    it
Then, it became pretty obvious
and I tried even harder
until I    simply couldn't any more (she officially told me they were together)
And    then
I had to do something
So
I tried to imagine it
I had a    facebook note indirectly about this
I established all sorts of things    like height, personality, whatever, and tried to piece together what it    would look like
I was extremely uncomfortable with her comment (about how    his height and hers worked
even though I was sort of getting to    this
Another thing is that I feel guilty about never really wanting to know    him
and now she's broken up with him and I probably never will
That's    kind of awkward
Plus, I've never broken up with anyone before
If I were    speaking with her, it might come to mind to ask her what it's like
I    can't help that I'm curious to experience the emotions of others
It's    just A) it's a tender thought, B) I'll be an ass if I ask, C) I wouldn't    be able to really understand even if she did tell me
I was telling my    parents during dinner about this idea: consume a raw lemon to show    empathy
The thing that really hit me when I thought about all this is: I am just    too selfish
I can not even try to deny that
When it comes down to it,    I'm just so uncomfortable with her breaking up with him, that I didn't    really try to finish my app and HW, so I could try and get down to comfort    her
That's the bottom line
A lot of other things I just simply cannot handle have been happening    recently
In a way, I'm glad Marissa and Rich broke up
That's not really    fair to my thoughts
let me rephrase
I'm relieved that Richard broke up    with her, because they were just TOO awkward to handle, most of the time,    and now I can sort of
Sasha gave me a hug
She likes me cheering for her
Laura, you too
The biggest one is: OMG STEPH AND JARED
I do NOT want to think about    those two being together in private
Ever
Please kill me
SO foul
Cannot    handle that
Then Abby called again
How much did I freak out
Gotta talk about Sunsets in Pennington     my road is always beautiful
The next road (lesbian's house) isn't so bad either
Even the highway is beautiful
It's almost like it was intended to be a    woods-lined interstate

The hilarious triple     Saturday, March 18th was entirely ridiculous
That's all there is to it
But you know, I've never been one to let things that simple just slide by
Well
it was our first track scrimmage, and after my second
and very    long swim season, I was surprisingly in shape for running
Every thing    worked well, with the exception of the sudden realization of exactly how    hard the ground is, and how much it kind of hurts to run on
This aside, I was pretty phyched for this run
This is where I would    finally see where I stood
Was I good enough
My first
event
was the high jump
Lets just say that it was windy, I've only ever jumped three times before    it, and I refused to take off clothes to jump properly
I easily sailed over 4' 3"
But then again
that's no great    accomplishment
My next three jumps were completely random pieces of trash (to keep this    paper PG rated)
so I ended up close to clearing 4'6"
I'm ALMOST, but    not quite, good enough to clear 6 inches below the starting height
I'm not entirely    sure anyone was quite 100% serious when they showed up that day
Not a    single person knew what was going on
I asked around for about 20 minutes    while doing random run-outs to keep warm in the crazy wind
Nobody knew    any more than I did
So
I just randomly walked over
and discovered    that I was perfectly on time to find out my heat
Go-Go second heat    action
The mile
is by far the most fun race I do
It doesn't take immense    amounts of speed or endurance
It just takes
well
basically nothing
As long as you can not break down TOO much
and you're not going TOO    slow, you'll be fine
everyone else seems to have a lot of these    problems
Especially this one really looney guy in the first heat
He probably ALL    OUT SPRINTED the first 100
but then he took like 5 steps
And jogged    in place looking behind him until he was in the middle of a big pack
It    was definitely one of the goofier things I've ever seen
I go out with the rest of the pack, and just follow along Leif
He starts    to lag behind a little, so I pass him on the inside
What a nice guy
moving over like that
Well, it didn't really matter, because right as we    began to hit the REALLY windy corner, this MASSIVE pack started to swarm    around me
Ok, well only like 2 other guys besides me and Leif were there, but it was    scary because suddenly everyone was passing me
Well, one of them turned    out to have a shirt that said "You could never keep up
I    would take the challenge
He was pretty good, so we zoooooooooooooomed up to the top 6 or 7
ish     We passed Richard, and I passed REALLY close to him, making him hit me
I    also told him to keep up
Honestly, getting so tired
needs to pull it    together
We all just go around and around the track, but I have a lot left in my by    the last 300ish
so I start passing random people
We all swing by and    into the finish
5:15
Cool
Go me
Haven't slowed down since last year apparently
Maybe    even a PR
I did little warm up runs to pass the time until I had a fun conversation    with Sarah and Marissa
They were running the 800
sounds like fun
I decided that the two mile wasn't that important
so I was going to run    the 800 too
I ran around some more to pass the time
I think being extremely well    warmed up and stretched is a very relaxing thing, because I really started    to stop caring about running at all
People started looking at me like I    was crazy
so I pretended that I wasn't going to do the two mile    afterward
A lot of them really had their doubts about it
I don't like the 800
I call it the half mile
because that's basically    how I run it
Its like this: you can run it a few different ways
and
stuff
Ok well
whatever     The point is you can either A) follow someone, B) pace yourself, or C) run    as fast as you can
and just make sure you don't die at the end
That day, I did mostly A for my mile
and the 800 basically forced me    into C
After a couple extra striders than is necessary, I take of my sweatshirt    and hop onto the track
right as the gun goes off
Oops
might have    wanted to be there BEFORE the race started
Oh well
We go out hard
I'm seriously at the wayyyyyyyyyy back
I'm also seriously going as fast as I can
Hmmmm
I think to myself
Oh well
We did our two laps, and basically the entire time I was thinking that I    couldn't go any faster
I just didn't have the muscle to speed up
I wasn't tired or anything
just not as fast
This
is why I'm not a sprinter
I'm really freaking slow
The only reason I did decently was because I didn't slow down
and    everyone else did
Two twenty something
Cool
I've gotten faster since last year
even    though I've only run that once before
Well, I felt really good afterwards
so I slipped on some more clothes    and whined about how I'm not built for speed at all
Oh well
Now here's where things started getting screwy
The officials called all 2 milers gather up
and I'm the only one on my    team
I talk to some other team
Its weird
and awkward
who runs like an 11:30
Good
Because me neither
but does anyone want to pace me
RUINS MY LIFE
Well, I see a little mass of 200ers, so I figure I have to warm up again
I follow Christian's and Kita's advice of "go run some laps"
unfortunately one of them didn't realize I wasn't done yet, and I didn't    realize I had so freaking long until my race
I started getting cold and    tight, because I figured my race was going to be in like 5 minutes
It    turns out that sprinters
have large numbers
The 200 went on for at    least 20 minutes
The sprinters must pop out of the ground when its time    for them to race
There looked like only 2 more heats at most, but    nooooooooooo
They just kept showing up and running
It took FOREVER
And    the whole time I was wondering A) will these warm-ups drain me for my    race
because I've been doing them for a while
and B) ARE THEY DONE    YET
I didn't even bother to put my sweatpants back on until I realized    that this could go on forever
There was an ENDLESS supply of sprinters
until I put on my sweatpants
Then there's only two heats left
I'm freezing and pissed
but once we get onto the track
I meet my    good friend
Pacerbuddy (yes, that is a made up name, but he paced my    mile
and he had the "you could never keep up" shirt)
We have a nice    little meeting
We all talk about California starts (girls got forced, complaining, onto    the Cali
it was funny because one of them said "but what if we want to    run with the boys
The gun goes off
and I'm pretty sure I cut off like 5 people at least
I practically instantaneously make my way from the outside lane 5 to the    inside of lane 2
so I'm pretty sure some angry people were involved    somewhere behind me
Oops
oh well
I wasn't planning on running it seriously
and the thought occurs to me    as I watch a pack of actually serious runners take the lead and break    away
PSSHHHHHH
who wants to RUN the two mile
That's the loser thing    to do
I decide to take a nice 11:30ish cruise 2 mile
It's kind of    fast
but not really
I think (sadly) that my PR from last year was like    11:20
So I'm going at a decent pace
in a decent position
when my shoes    decide to be INdecent
and undress themselves
Of all the nerve
Ok, well, maybe it IS my fault for forgetting to tie them before my    race
but I'm coming down the straightaway to finish my first lap and I    look down
and smile
I pull myself together
but yell out some comments to some of my    teammates who are cheering me on
For one
they don't really need to    waste their breath
it's a scrimmage
It's not entirely serious,    although I'm as anxious as the next person to find out where I stand
Also
the one mile race
SO FUN
I couldn't wait
Well
now I'm stuck there on my second lap
wondering what to do with    my shoes
at first it was only the right
and then the left got loose    too
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
The next four laps are filled with me occasionally loosing a grip and just    smiling and laughing at myself
and the repeated desire to just duck    down behind the pole-vault mats and tie my shoe out of sight of the    officials
I hear some voices every now and then cheering me on
as well    as Leif's "DON'T TIE YOUR SHOE"     (to which I say "PLEASE
I REALLY WANT TO
not bad
Oldfield wants me to run seriously
If my    shoes had been tied
and I heard that split
I would have started to    pick it up
If I felt that good after a nice first mile like that
go    pull out some crazyness
I could've gone like 11:20 with that
But
I sort of just laughed
like those girls I passed every lap
who constantly laughed at me
Jerks
I found my buddy
and passed him
I was pretty bored, so I was like "look at my shoes
And tell me that    isn't Bad-@$$"     It was kind of a jerk thing to do, but I apologized at the finish line
Tee hee
11:38     My shoes are some bad @$$ Jamaicans
This is why Rutgers is not a serious school     9/2/09     Today, I got a message from "Danielle Ma" on facebook, saying to the    members of Rutgers Pick Up Soccer     Hey guys,     If you wanna play pick up today, come to the Busch turf fields at 5:30 til    sundown
Please message me if you can make it
Maybe I should skip math to play soccer
I saw Richard
and I was having a bad day so I gave the tiniest wave    ever
Felt kind of like an ass
So instead of studying for Bio, I    remembered thinking of this once, and wrote down basically what it was
I    have no life
so I'll run my ass off
Tired after the hard track workout, he sat down alone in silence 5 x 800,    and no matter how hard he tried, each one was slower than the last
As the    rest of the team panted and moaned in agony, he just sighed and looked    down at the old red rubber that covered the track
He absently picked at    it and watched the team limp away, legs burning
He got up with a faint smile, the first real glimmer of happiness he'd    shown in weeks
Recently his smile was forced, artificial
He knew    everyone could tell, so he slowly stopped bothering, and just ignored the    questions of "what's wrong
Avoidance and sarcasm were the only answers he had
Nothing was wrong
But    he knew nothing was quite right either
But today he smiled
For once the dull ache in his exhausted legs    distracted him from the emptiness he felt inside
At last he had a good    excuse to be silent and tired
It felt good to hear his heart churning    inside him, still beating quick from the effort
It reassured him that at    least something was still inside (of
It was nice to know that at    least part of him was as it should be
His heart had at least some    purpose
Though it was only keeping a pointless life going, he was    comforted that it was in the right place
His heart was now for only one    thing
His heart was for running
Today there was nothing of the sort
Only    disappointment was waiting for him at the finish line
He suddenly felt empty again
Tired legs and an aching body were no longer    enough
He felt like he was crushed by the sudden attention
Not even words
He was just a    hallow, empty machine
The only thing he could do with his shallow life    would be running
Make himself useful to someone before he was just thrown    out again
Even if it were just to kill the time until his heart failed    him too
For now, it beat on, and so he kept running

anyway, so i was going to my eighth grade dance, right, so this whole    speech will be exactly like i talk, gotcha
well, it might not be, but    who cares
the point was for the rest of you to watch my comma action and    learn about what happened the night of the eighth grade dance
anyway, so we kick it on the dance floor, but im in suit
so I JUST    STAND THERE     right, so anyway, to go back a little, i mean, in time, i didnt moonwalk    or anything, i'm just doing a flash back     theres something funny in my quotes section of my website about    flashbacks, go there now
anyway, im flashing-ewwwwww     back-ohhh
flash back  -in case you couldnt tell     Setting: im in the car with my bad dad     im making fun of him for not living up to his bad dad reputation    and driving me     there are two big bundles of people     one, closer to me, is all of the "pimpin' guys"  further off is the girls,    and boys that are *real pimps* as they hang out solely with girls
all the    gay kids are with the pimpin' boys, obviously
seriously, what gay kid    would want to hang out with girls
or at least manly men, who can tell these days
right so flashback dad says, "where should i drop you off
so i'm like, "ill get off here, cuz im one of the pimps"     i jump out of the window, tuck, and roll as his monster truck rolls over    the rest of the crowd     thankfully only ugly single dads were hurt
the crowd immediately notices, "HEY, ITS DELUCCA,     and hes pinmpin'
heres one of the big differences between girls and boys, other than i    noticed that girls were better looking     the crowd immediately notices, "HEY, ITS DELUCCA,     and his hair is flat
bi o-organic lifeform
ohhhhhhhhhhh, burn
anyway, flashing forward to where i'm just standing around, something    tragic happens
this girl Racheal C
starts attacking me     im sure i deserved it but i forget why
so as she turns around, i poke her in the back, intending to stab her with    my long, pointy
fingernails
any of you who expected PENIS are sadly mistaken- oops there    it is           anyway, fate has it that right where i strike her, happens to hold an    intruiging object beneath her shirt
intruiged, i poke it again, and figure out exactly what it was     "oh
eww           she whips around and starts attacking me screaming YOU SICKO, that one i    really deserved
nervous and afraid, i run away and get several free drinks and some    crunchy thing wrapped in bacon
it was good
while im sitting enjoying my drink with a few friends that happened to be    there, an unlikely pair arrive by my side
Jessie LAZUR and Kristen Birdsie, well however you spell thier names
anyway, so they appear, both, by the way, looking absolutely FABulous
ok, now my masculine side is coming, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh     anyway so they're both drop dead gorgous,     well at least Birdsie is, Lazur is beautiful, and at least an inch taller    with heels
So i wave to them both and jessie holds out her hand
about to kiss it, i remember that im still a kissing "virgin" and that    we're not in a '60s movie     i take her hand and bow, to dance, yet another fine point of a sixties    movie     little do they all know, ive never SEEN a sixties movie     unless greese is one, and ive seen that at least three times     we do a little shuffle from side to side, when she unexpectedally spins    around
ok
ill play along
i do a very ungraceful spin, and she laughs openly at me
very sad, nearly heart broken, actually, i sit down and comment about how    little alcohol is in my drink, specifically none since i dont drink
the two girls i was sitting with note this, though i was sure i only    thought it, and say, "if you dont go
i mean, flashing back     ok, now its tuesday, or monday     who can tell anyway
HAHAHAHA     anyway, flashback jeff is hunched over a once clean napkin, that has black    permanant marker all over it now     the marker bleeds over the table revealing the works written on the    napkin
as the napkin goes in flashback jeff's pocket, the camera zooms in on the    blood on the table
give me a break, im trying to do creative workplay
THIS IS NOT A HIT LIST
the "master plan" was all of the people i was going to ask     ok ok, more names           Kristin Birdsey             Laura Mraz     (lines from both converging on
ok so, ahem, right now we're in the gym (dancefloor) again, and im feeling    guilty, lonely, and i think im in love
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh     anyway, just kidding on the last one
hehe     no, she just laughs too hard, and this being a serious manner, i show    great self restraint and keep a straight face
am i being too hard on her     well it doesnt matter because nobody goes on my website to read it    anyway
as the only one laughing, jessie pulles herself together quickly     "anyway
umm
at the beginning of this week, well, not the beginning,    but it was monday, well, at lunch anyway
THE END
great story
I don't know whether or not you've had this experience or not, but it's a    bit likely seeing as I do all sorts of crazy, stupid things
sorry about    that
Speaking of which, the whole library research thing really screws me up    because one time I went down to the class and the room was dark, but I    just went back to band instead of going to hang out with you for another    minute or two
It's kinda not fair because you can just hang out in the    three-hundred hall and go straight across to go to the library
Well, onto another long, rambling story, but this time I have to go for    some major "style points" otherwise I might be majorly screwed
Unlike almost every other story, this one starts with a boy
Don't cut    him any slack just because you're in love with him
He's taken too
After    borrowing your phone and walking you about 50 yards from the track, I    headed back to grab Kevin and my stuff so we could leave
Looking about, I    see a sea of people
Focusing in like I learned to so long ago, I watched    each individual clump for someone who looked like him
A massive line    fenced in the pole vault runway, and even went to surround the pads
Scanning quickly through them I saw no one who looked like him
I moved on to the scoring/official booth
Or whatever
Basically that    little table near the finish line
After the two main clusters mentioned,    I just briefly scanned the rest of the field before deciding to go to the    school and continuing my search there
This is why it's all his fault
If he would have been right there for me    to see, or didn't blend in, I wouldn't have jogged up to the school,    stopping by about
of the team to ask if they had seen him
If I hadn't    been jogging, I wouldn't have had this whole mess
So anyways, I'm running along, and I see this car
This car
HAS    ANNA
So I wave
The car drives right past me with nobody waving back,    but as it goes I realize you were sitting in the back seat
You apparently    didn't see me either
Looking up to my destination, I see Sophie walking    out of the school
Two things happen simultaneously in my mind
First I    think "Its Sophie
The second thing that goes through my    brain is "HI SOPHIE
I think, "I'll just run up and    say hello again
By then I'm right    next to Sophie, so I say "HI Sophie
a random thought takes action without being passed by my brain at    all
I snatch up Sophie's hands and say, "pretend to be holding hands with    me, Marissa's to our right" I flick my eyes in that general direction
Naturally, as I not only slur my words when I'm out of breath but also    talk really quickly when I'm excited, Sophie asks
Is in that car
Over There" I say gesturing with my head in    your direction
As she looks, I excitedly talk
She's going to think she caught me doing something weird, and then    she'll freak out
I'll never hear the end of it
I    immediately drop her hands and pretend to be guilty
hi
um
Turning back to the door, I realize that you    can see reflections in the door
That might have ruined it
Me, You, and Anna enter the school, and suddenly you sprint off
This is the experience I was talking about in the beginning
Something you    see or hear suddenly makes you afraid
As you sprinted off, the joke    suddenly wasn't quite as funny anymore
I thought I actually hurt you,    that you really thought I was with Sophie
And now, you were sprinting    away- to hide tears maybe
To just get out of an awkward situation
I    don't know
I just made me suddenly afraid
As you rapidly disappeared, Anna said
Only now I didn't have the opportunity to explain things, which was never    the idea
So
I walked
I looked at Anna
and then I sprinted off after you
At the first turn, I skipped to slow down and prevent the slip I felt    coming
Now I could see you, but I was chasing after you again, and gaining    slightly
I called out Happily "MARISSA
What could I do
I just kept running after you
You're an awfully fast sprinter
or else I just suck
You probably weren't even going all out, but I was just to catch up
As    you passed the intersection at the 100-hall I knew you would get to the    locker room before I could get to you
I stopped for a second, but realized that then I would never have a    chance, so had to catch up again
Maybe that was the janitor closet or    something
I guess you know the rest, but It really had me freaked out
Since I don't want to ruin the effect of that at least halfway decent    writing, I'll fill up the rest of the space with pretty drawings
If we said the things we thought
How would life be different
Well, for one, you would have seen this Kelly thing coming, because    sometime when we passed her I would say "There's Kelly" in a flirty mean    way
Like
bleh
ewww Kelly
But then right after
I would have    added "the girl I'm always flirting with in lunch and Spainish
But then
things would have their downsides too
Like
dirty thoughts
People would think of me as basically an ass
Wow I'm really tired
And also
you would CONSTANTLY hear things about you body
except that today you didn't smell nice
Every    once in a while you smell this way
think along the line of burned    things
Its sad, because usually I get a rather euphoric scent whenever    we're close
By the way
I feel really guilty about being mean all the time
I sort    of hinted at it by saying that Megan's comments are probably funnier
nicer too
I guess I love you
but only sometimes
Well
you know
stuff
Sweet form
Today, an astonishing idea hit me
What would happen if someone made a movie all about running
My first thought was to have it as a documentary
For some reason, when I think of documentaries, I always see them set in    New York
The camera zooms in on a shirtless guy, drenched in sweat at an    intersection
He's in shorts, and has a towel tucked into his shorts
He sighs, breathes hard once, and moans
He rubs a sweaty, soaked arm across his dripping face
His long, brown    hair is matted with sweat
Snot still sticks to his face, and he    straightens up to give his testimony
puff puff
see, gasp, Running is a YEHAHGA"     "excuse me
what
gasp
dedication
cough, gasp
I run a 15 minute 5k
It was sort of Andrew Seems-esqu
type production
Or maybe more like    Shaolin Soccer-ish
Kung Fu Hustle-y
One guy in an Under Armor Tee and really HUGE shoes is sitting on those    benches in front of the school
He's wearing a pair of those "R" shorts
He's really scrawny, and the Underarmor shows his rib bones
He has some sweet shades on too
Suddenly some other runner comes sprinting in
With a cape
Also, "RUNNERS    4 LIFE" white shirt on (homemade- with really huge, obnoxious lettering,    meant to look really ghetto- all torn up everywhere and completely    ridiculously dripping wet
The standing one grabs a Gatorade and chugs it - spilling everywhere
His shirt keeps squirting all over the sitting kid
He's wearing some ridiculously mud encrusted shoes too
either that or the    oldest, most broken up shoes, held together mostly by duct tape
sitting one (2): NOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
1: YEAH IT WAS FREAKING 20 MILES
2: NO WAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
HOW FAST
1: IT WAS LIKE A FRIGGIN MILE PR
EVERY MILE
2: NOOOOOO WAIIIIIIIIIIIII
1: WAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
2: DUDE I'M ABOUT TO RUN WOOSAMONSA 20 TIMES STRAIGHT
WANNA COME
1: NO FRIGGIN WAY
IM SO SORE RIGHT NOW I'M ABOUT TO SHOOT LACTIC ACID OUT    OF MY EYES
2: HOLY CRAP NO WAY
U'D BETTER STRETCH THAT OUT DUDE
number "1" guy starts doing really freaky contortion stuff and yoga poses
2: WOAH CHECK THAT OUT
a really hot girl starts running by, and right behind her is this    hideously ugly person
The hot girl is windmilling and looking ridiculous, but she's really hot
the hideously ugly person is running like a normal person     The camera zooms in on the two guys' faces, and they get all slackjawed    and stare
The camera starts zooming in on the really hot person, and starts going in    slo-mo (one of the boys says "man, get that out of here
And then
suddenly switches to the ugly person and goes in slo-mo
1&2: WOAHHHHHHHHHHHH
Ugly girl starts going into sprint finish, and overtakes the hot girl, who    slows down and winks at the boys
and walks to them all seductively
1&2: SWEET FORM
2: damn that was HOT
hot girl: sighs and walks away
AS IT APPEARED IN R2C conference:     OMG NO WAI D@V1D 15 tH3 1337 H@X0R     except for the fact that it says "from: David Siuta"     at the top of his posts, even if he does the wierd thing with the names     oh well, we'll just ignore that
in other news, has jared replied yet about which ones he's racing and    which ones i'm racing
or do i have to remember to ask him in person
And
in more news
Do you ever find yourself all alone, and then the most random idea hits    you
A while ago, that happened to me, and i tried to write it down, but i sort    of got a few things sideways from what they were in my mind
Which means    basically that this could have been a lot better, but A) i forgot a few    things B) i put in a few extra things and C) i'm too lazy to come up with    a better final copy
here we go     Sweet form

The camera zooms in on a shirtless guy, drenched in sweat at an    intersection

You can tell right away, he's one of those total wierdos that devote    themselves ENTIRELY to something, and they're really obnoxiously proud of    it
The type of person who's entire life is that one thing, and so    consequently they're really a pain in the ass
I think you know the type
He sighs, breathes hard once, and moans
He rubs a sweaty, soaked arm across his dripping face
His long, brown    hair is matted with sweat

Jeffrey63090:
nothing     Jeffrey63090: well sort of     IwillTry2FixU: tell me
Jeffrey63090: it was rather fun
IwillTry2FixU: T E L L M E     Jeffrey63090: ok well     Jeffrey63090: see, a loooooooooooooooooooooong time ago     Jeffrey63090: god made men and women     Jeffrey63090: and see
jeffrey had always been a man     Jeffrey63090: lol     IwillTry2FixU: wut about the apes
Jeffrey63090: and
rosie was a woman     Jeffrey63090: they were
put in zoos     Jeffrey63090: and some were lucky and got to eat bananas     Jeffrey63090: lol     IwillTry2FixU: ok lol     Jeffrey63090: anyways     IwillTry2FixU: keep goin     Jeffrey63090: jeff=man, rosie=woman right
IwillTry2FixU: yeah     Jeffrey63090: and also a long time ago, there were other people, but they    dont really matter     IwillTry2FixU: yeah screw those people     Jeffrey63090: so, there was this rosie fellow, and she was very pretty     Jeffrey63090: and had such an amazing personality     IwillTry2FixU: lol     Jeffrey63090: that it was just too bad that jeffrey was taken     Jeffrey63090: and then he got un-taken     Jeffrey63090: so for a bit he just sat about and did random things     Jeffrey63090: but there was rosie     Jeffrey63090: and she wasnt going to stand for this     Jeffrey63090: so she picked jeff up and threw him     Jeffrey63090: quite violently i might add     Jeffrey63090: in a figurative sense     IwillTry2FixU: llol     Jeffrey63090: and so
jeff basically was forced to be all
running    around and such because of rosie     Jeffrey63090: and it was all because she was just way too pretty and cool    to just sit down     IwillTry2FixU: lol     Jeffrey63090: and then jeff had a brilliant and very strange plan     Jeffrey63090: and it was mostly all because of a hug he got     Jeffrey63090:
and the ones before it     Jeffrey63090: but mostly because of this one he had this plan     Jeffrey63090: so he decided he was going to play a little game     Jeffrey63090: he would MAKE rosie want to ask him out     Jeffrey63090: because jeffrey was never
that smooth     Jeffrey63090: lol     Jeffrey63090: it was a sort of game
until rosie started winning     IwillTry2FixU: lol u pretty smooth     Jeffrey63090: and then jeffrey crashed and burned     Jeffrey63090: and it was funny     Jeffrey63090: but terrible     IwillTry2FixU: jeff i always win     Jeffrey63090: lol     Jeffrey63090: yeah basically     Jeffrey63090: so what'd you think of the story     IwillTry2FixU: and im not that smooth at all prolly the least     Jeffrey63090:

Jeffrey63090: you can just cheat
and leave instead of asking me out     Jeffrey63090: and then i'll probably have to do it     Jeffrey63090: this sux     IwillTry2FixU: well thats the way im thinkin     Jeffrey63090: cheater     IwillTry2FixU: lol     Jeffrey63090: ;you know what     IwillTry2FixU: im a winner

This cannot be denied
It is my intention to sit down    and play video     games for several hours
First, moving around quickly, and with purpose, is a true sign of    character
Secondarily, bustle(e
g
hustle) yields more product for the working    types
Webster's defines bustle as    "excited and     often noisy activity; a stir
Finally, sometimes gross    stuff can be funny
In conclusion, I, "The Yellow Dart," think I have done a great job    illustrating the     many differing opinions about hustle and bustle, may they both rest in    peace
Also, I     think Strong Bad should decrease The Cheat's allowance

4/18/09     My method of storytelling is a failure     Not only because most people are not interested in the underlying logic    and system of thinking and being of most events (they are more focused on    the actual plot and whether the outcome is interesting)     But because I fail to convey the importance of the underlying logic, and    also fail to accurately convey the thinking
My drug of choice: Marissa Greco     Side effects include:     -extreme attacks of guilt     -shortened attention span     -"sexual side-effects" (that's a good one
it WOULD be humorous if it did not pertain to you, but that's    too bad
Smile on little man
This thought often cam to mind "My drug of choice: Marissa Greco" during    the health stuff
I mean, honestly, its just like a drug too
Rapid    addiction, all those side effects listed above, and (my personal favorite)    withdrawal symptoms and increased tolerance
That last one's a real pain in the you-know-where
I find myself needing    you just to function normally
That's not healthy
That's why I'm so sad    to hear you're leaving me for a WHOLE week
I could DIE by then, and not    be happy about it
That would make me sad
And what if something wildly    important happens
What then
Not to make you feel bad or anything (well,    maybe a little
My worst fear about the whole thing is what if someone else "comes into    the picture
They would probably dump me in a week    (I'm surprised you haven't yet either, but you're just weird like that)
And after they leave me to die, I'll be all alone
You'd hate me for    stabbing you in the back, I'd hate me for stabbing EVERYONE in the back,    and generally it would be a mess
I don't want that
What you SHOULD do is    meet a hot sexy guy in Vermont and have an affair so I look good by    comparison
Well, now that I made you fear for your young life, and have sufficiently    made you doubt me, lets move onto the bad news
I've decided I'm going to    never ever leave you and cling on like a lichen to stone until some kind    of Eskimo scoops me up and eats me for dinner
A very colorful picture of    what is to follow
Try not to dump me too soon, I wouldn't like that very    much
There is a very good story behind my card by the way, but I cant share it    now because its important to try to sleep instead of spending all night    "daydreaming" about oddities of my life
I blame you
Asshole day: 11/19/08     For some reason, everyone was being an asshole today
According to Luke, the internet
According to me: Kin, Chris and Spiros
Kin, I    think, is generally an asshole
So
I ended up with this (As Luke complains about his webreg-rightfully    so, because he's been trying to register for well over an hour, and with    impossibly bad luck
stuff I wasn't really listening to because it has    nothing to do with me"     "Can you do me a favor
Ok
There was a time, at about 10:18, when most of everyone had already    registered for at least a few classes, and Luke still had yet to make one    attempt
I walked in
and there was just this heavy, heavy silence
And the first thing I thought to myself was "this air
Luke stinks at Fallout 3
Thing is
if your play style is very    "Hack and slash"
pick stats that reflect it
And also, I have no idea    what his tag skills are
and neither does he
Whatever it is
he's    very noob at this sort of thing
And doesn't ever use VATS
That's pretty    much the best thing in the game
and I can't even function without it,    practically
Keep Your Cool     Tuesday 10/3/06     Tuesdays are meet days
Today was all about keeping it cool
One last    thing: it was Hat and Sunglasses Day for our Spirit Week leading up to    Homecoming
Ok now that there's the setting, you just need to know about the actors
I    got about an extra hour of sleep the night before so I could do well at    the meet
That might've helped for this whole calmness business
I've been    sort of floating around in the way of girls, and I've done a lot of    talking about who I WISH would be my buddy
Buddy as in someone who's    buddy-buddy with me
So, you wake up, you do your thing, and you get on with the important    things
That's how my morning went, but with a bit of extra hustle and    bustle
I had a lot of extra things to do today
I had to make sure I was    wearing my brand new baby blue "Run for Wrobo" shirt (we were all going to    match)
I had to grab a hat
I had to pack my running bag
I had to get    some snacks for my new meet day routine (which has been working pretty    darn well)
I had to carry my sax in to school
All sorts of rather uninteresting things
Sort of
My hat was a Bright    Yellow chicken hat with Red Frills
All this junk I had to carry in won me    a ride from my mom (instead of hassling with trying to carry it all onto a    cramped bus
I suddenly wondered at why I felt this way
This day should have had my    heart pounding with excitement, or at least filled to the brim with    energy
We just had a three day weekend, I had a meet to look forward to,    I was going to match half the X-C team, and I was wearing something crazy    and eye-catching (a favorite activity)
But all I felt was
a calm
You    know how people sometimes talk about the stillness of a lake's surface in    the morning
Or, I don't know
the perfect, brisk air after a rough    storm (that one I know exists, and it's REALLY cool
Everything was just still and perfect
You know what I think
I think that things are best left to things
Yeah
Well, so what if that didn't make any sense
the point is that    other people are right (oh no
self contradiction
Thinking is bad for your heart anyway,    made me sadistic     Yup, yup, I used to be an OPTIMIST, now I'm evil and like pain
very bad    for me
Actually that one commenting on my "loser" was really mean, I don't like    you, im thinking maybe I SHOULD have flamed you
yeah, definitely     If nothing else, I could at least have
uh
online six pack jocking    stuff going on
Well, actually, on the internet, everyones a bully, unless you don't want    to be
but theres very few people with actual self control
The other ones were funny
really     That whole thing chain on me not being original made me smile     It was fun for a while     But now the problem is
you made lots of MEAN people come going around    leaving anonymous insults
I've heard of secret Santa, and secret admirer
but never
no actually    the whole secret insulter thing was on Calvin and Hobbes once, so its not    that new     Well, despite all that, you have to admit you went a tad too far calling    people pimple headed, and such, calling people losers, and making fun of    ideas that
as once Maddie pointed out
hey, wait a minute, now its    gone
well the point is that I copy stuff from other people, use mixes of    writing styles, and of course, being all emotional and such as I am
about half of whatever current ideas I have are based on what recently    happened and how I feel at that exact moment
See, but at least I freely admit it, and said sorry, many, many times     And, because of all that, I can guilt-free laugh my head off at all of it    and look like im high     Just wondering
to everyone out there, how many of you think im high,    like, constantly     Annnnnnyway, back to the subject     I think the nice, AND hilarious thing to do right now would be use that    outrageously bored mind of yours, write something witty, APOLOGETIC, and    flame me ONE LAST TIME, and then disappear forever, or just reveal your    identity, and be like one big happy online family     Or, ill just switch most of my entries to friends only, which I wouldn't    like at all     Just think about it for a while- jeff     PS
that was freaking hilarious if you think about it
I hung up the phone pretty
abruptly
I'm sorry
That was kind of rude    of me
I think maybe I hold the mouthpiece too low
It is rather near my    chin
Maybe under
Think back to why I'm walking
Alone
Because I didn't want to be there    anymore
Because I have better things to do
Like what
Let's not have a repeat of last time with Logue
Nothing that I really need to do
Nothing that I couldn't do    here
I would be more at home
there
Ha
At my home, obviously
But is it really so obvious
Stop
Because Kita
had to talk with Kelsey
No, simply because I didn't want    to be waiting in that room
Doing nothing
As I walked out, I purposefully didn't look back to the female voice that    was directly to my left
I didn't want Kelsey to think I had come out to    listen to her chat with Kita
It was none of my business
The less I knew    of it, the better
But I heard my name called out
I took a few more steps before stopping
I    took a second before deciding I really did have to turn around
It was Steph
I thought it was
But I was most surprised when Kelsey and    Kita were NOT hanging by the door
I guess it would be safe to walk back    to say hi
what'd you do
Did you go back to your house to play Frisbee
We did
other stuff
It felt pretty good to be asked that
But I didn't have an    answer
One that I would say, at the least
And everything is odd angles
Odd angles
Odd angles cause pain
Is that why they respond to odd angles
It only makes sense
So is that    why cubism ever existed
But what about "natural angles" like phi of the    Da Vinci code
I don't need to be any more mentally unstable than I already am
So    please
Stop
Especially if you do this on purpose
I guess she's like me in a lot    more ways than I've ever really noticed before
Shukuchi
The coming     Tap tap tap     The sound of my own heavy footfalls rang silently, defeated by the    overwhelming quiet of my thoughts
Tap tap tap     Back and forth, the rhythmic beating taking me to a far off place and    back, within the blink of an eye     Pacing, before dawn
Those heavy booted feet bringing the plans of    tomorrow, the siege
He could imagine the horrors of the next day, the    battle cry of the demented souls as they came into view
The screech of    the mutilated undead as they climbed up to fight their once brethren
Multitudes of them, as the plagued scouts had seen
They would not be    stopped until the last of the lkiving had been demented to their cause
So    he paced
The soft rustle of his cloak masked the quiet, secretive motions    of another
Sneaking up, behind, following the very breath of the soon to    be prey, follower braced to leap, and
A sudden cry brings me back
Another follows, but the pacing continues, this time a harsh insult    follows it
I brace for his attack, and count down from 3     2     1     Right on time, the other spins me around, gripping to the floor with a    slight duck, I fist hands and prepare for another attack
Only an insult follows, and I return to the incessant pacing
My focus lost, I look around in gloomy silence
Where once was silence and    solitude there is now the din of Childs play
I paced on, more careful of    the floating bodies flung across the room
Grinning happily as the lock slowly clicks open and swings quietly open I    entered, the gentle pacing filled the room
Snickering softly, knowing all    to well what would happen soon, I masked my own light footfalls in the    heavy booted ring of the other
The other was turning, so the follower    made a wide arc, careful as not to be even close to being seen
The    footsteps merged as the two came slowly closer and closer
I braced to    leap and grabbed out the staff both weapon and shield, tool and creation
I leaped up, and grabbed onto a long thin strand of magic
Wrapping the    sticking line around my hands, I twisted them into a complex web of    invisible strands and pulled hard
I felt it wrap around his body, and    immediately became distinctly aware of something wrong
Twisting in    midair, I knew for sure that I was under attack
A shadow flew up the hardwood surface and crawled up my body
I became    conscience of a flying object and tracked it's shadow for it's direction
It flew into a net with a soft whoosh
My focus further deteriorated, I made a conscience effort to bring back    the dark imaginings of a borrowed dream
Once upon a time, there was a young lad who changed the world with his shy    smile and intense focus
A long time ago, there was a special group of people called RUNNERS
The    runners have a myth about a man
No, not a myth about a man
But a    LEGEND of a HERO
His name was "Evan of the Many Trees" and he lived in a    small village called Titusville
Since birth, he was destined for great things
Noble Runners' blood flowed    in his veins
It was as if he was chosen to by the gods to lead us on our    path
TO VICTORY
When he was but 2 years old, he could run a 10 minute    mile
At the age of 12, 6 minute mile
And from there he only improved
Sir John Zalot once said that Kita (Many Trees) was one of the most    natural runners he had ever laid eyes on
His legs carried him with    swiftness and ease
At the young age of 14, he had already completed a    half marathon in
cough cough minutes
But, despite the strong blood in his veins, and the natural gifts he was    granted
all was not well
A great witch and ancient nemesis cast a    spell to attack the Band of Iliotibius (IT band)
Hearing the cry, a shaman doctor known only as TC came along to try and    help
Kita was told to rest
Kita didn't get much better
Eventually, a wizard came along and Kita got a lot better
6/14/04     Dear Mrs
Goldman     I think the phase is "think, then speak," but in this case, we may adapt    it to think, then do
Clearly I have never learned this lesson
As part of    my punishment, I had to detail exactly what I was doing and why
It's a    good think I like story-telling so much, otherwise that might have been a    dislikable activity
The only downside thus far, is that I had to keep a    straight face the whole time and ran out of counter arguments halfway    thorough
Moving on from that little tidbit, I believe thanks and sincere apologies    are in order to you
I would personally like to thank you for the second    chance of the sludge lab, and apologize that you may have been coerced
Rumor has it that another teacher was furious at you and mentioned    "lawsuit
Another apology that I would like to extend to you was that I could not    have been of more help in "taming" the class and generally being out of    line
As far as I recall, there were three incidents, all of which I am    deeply sorry for
Hopeful for yet another chance,                                                               Jeffrey De Lucca                                                                        6/14/04     Mrs
Goldman:     It is one of my deepest regrets that I chose to act the way in which I    did
I had no right, and no need, to misbehave in the manner in which I so    chose
In saying this I refer to the three incidents that have marred the    cleanliness of your otherwise spotless room
First, I am deeply sorry for not thinking through my sludge lab, a mistake    that may have been a threat to other students, were you not there to    immediately choke the fire in a heroic effort
Second, I ask of you forgiveness on the manner which was both unnecessary    and distracting to the class
This was, of course the act jumping about    like a wild cretin in the back of the room during a review for a later    test
Though I needed not the review, I was a distraction to the rest of    the class
Third, I would be so obliged if you would pardon my act of blatant    stupidity in climbing out of a window
There was no reason for it besides    the intolerable heat, which could have been aided by asking of a pass to    the water fountain
Once again sorry:     Jeffrey De Lucca
Anagrams prove to be quiet difficult sometimes
so we all need help at    some point
the trick is to find the answer amongst all this mess
perhaps the answer could be over there, or it could be here     who knows, it might even be IN YOUR MIND ALREADY     inyourmind     what do all people make but no one can ever see or touch

Someone lost
A dream on 2/8/09- after making Elaine's clan dinner, during    a drought, and having visited Florida that winter break
She lived side by side with me, and hated everything I loved
Especially    in concern with food, she was pleased by the perfect opposite
And so, I    was hesitant
I remember there was something about pepperoni pizza, and    that we had many of the same classes together
At the very least, we were    always together, and though I had strong feelings for her, I felt as if it    would never work out
Then, I Know that I went to Florida, by car, and that I was attempting to    smuggle some weed back
The bag was large, and filled also with various    herbs and seeds and flowers
There were white things, and black orbs and    brown things, and only at the very bottom was weed
I think Kita was    somehow involved in this as well
But when I returned, I was saddened to learn that she was currently going    out with, and fucking, a guy from a few houses to my right, so that if I    looked out the window, I could see their room, as it was on the side wall
I tried desperately to reach her, and let her know that I was back, and    that I wanted to see her, but it seemed useless
Perhaps that was all in    my mind though, for I remember that upon arrival to my room, I turned on    the light, and a friend said "hey they're fucking, turn off the light or    they'll see us"
So I turned off the light, and looked out the window
They could see us
So I turned the light back on, but decided that I would    rather have it off
On,off,on,off
Only two cycles total
But it was enough for them to notice, and for her to care
They    immediately stopped, without finishing
And she stormed out
In a moment,    she purposefully stormed past my door, wearing very little clothes, and a    blanket
I didn't react
Soon, her boyfriend, who's name started with a J, and had a last or middle    name starting with a T
T
not sure) came in
He was    widely known to have been having nearly indiscriminant sex with a whole    lot of girls during my absence of two months (I think
She must have seen that it    was me, and came running
Eventually, I have him convinced that he is doing something that is not    quite right
And in a gently depressing way, he shows that he is somehow    empty, and filling his void with girls
Then She comes back in, using her position with another man to bring    jealousy, anger, Pain
She seems to be bragging about having moved on, in    order to convince herself
The more she talks, the more pain she feels,    compounded by her new boyfriend's VERY apparent indifference
She feels anger, betrayal, disappointment
How could I have left her
Didn't I love her
Why couldn't we have been together
After some time, I am coaxing her tears away, bringing her into my arms,    and telling her that everything would be forgiven
We could be together,    if she would only say that she loved me
As proof of her pain during my absence, she handed me a "homework"    assignment type thing
On a sheet of loose leaf paper, was written:     1
Jeff has gone away
How do you feel about this
Happy or sad
Do you remember what was missing from Family on Mars
Yes, it was the "elephant words" like family or commitment
On the back, there was a third question, probably about her new J
T
She rested to my right, in the crook of my arm, on a couch
I leaned    against her shoulder, as I put her paper aside
We could be together
We could be happy
Her warmth and softness was so present in my mind, and on my arm
My left    hand crept up to her right breast, and played the soft nipple to hardness
This time will be different
Now is different
I would gladly change my    entire body for you
Yes, she replies, "but I know you don't really want to rub there
And were they true
My left    hand freezes, even as I deny the words
Suddenly, I am detached, far away
Up until that moment, we had been rapidly coming together
Suddenly she is    distant, cold, dead
What's wrong
What changed
I say "That's because, I'd rather use it to bring you closer to me
And reality rips, as the dream ends, her soft lips brushing against mine
It wasn't always clear from the beginning, but it was obvious when I    looked for it
It was obvious on the day of the quad one barbeque    (September 11th North Carolina
I distinctly remember thinking "she and    I are very different people, and I should stay away from her
I kept very quiet when she was around, and I disliked    when she came to visit Sunny and Ammaar's room
But really, try to say these things when I'm not around, and don't say    them so loud
Do you simply not realize that I'm right here
Or, that it    was obvious from the way you look at me
It could be just one of those    underlying things, everyone knows it and everything would be fine as long    as we stayed out of each others' way
But
when you say shit like that,    it kind of hurts
And makes you want to retaliate
But, we are very different people, and as long as I keep my side of the    bargain, we can leave it one of those underlying things
We can remain    completely distant, and never talk to each other again
This is a good plan
If you need more direct details, this is about Jaymee saying, quite loudly    (at 2:20 am on 10/9/08 after everyone got done doing Mastering Chemistry)    "What do you think about Jeff" and "He's kind of a Creep
do you honestly think I MEAN to be creepy
Not my fault I    see things differently, and I think of things differently, and that I    behave differently
It is my fault that I don't bother to act normal    anymore, but what kind of hell would it be to be fake every day of my    life
And it is my fault that I don't bother to explain much anymore,    mostly because when I honestly try my very hardest, it's still muddled and    confusing, and pretty much nobody gets it
So yes, I am a creep
But not so much that I have become dangerous or in    any way threatening
And certainly not enough to deserve having to hear    your shit from next door
I'm hella pissed, and the next time I see you, you'll probably pick up on    it right away
But don't say that shit aloud, and the world will be    better
We BOTH know that the other is not someone we want to be involved    with, in any way
I think that if we actually talked to each other, we would both agree that    the less we see of each other, the better off things would be
It's worked before: Max Orlando and I once stated flat out that we    strongly dislike the other, for very weak and meaningless reasons
It was    clear and apparent the whole time, and not a single thing changed after    the conversation
And not a single thing would ever change in that    relationship, except for a small increase in the amount of respect I had    for him
Him to me
I noticed he never went out of his way to bother me,    but don't remember if he ever did that to begin with
So
stay out of my way, and we will remain acquaintances that dislike    each other, for a host of reasons that nobody cares about

oh and you'd be so proud of me, i didn't dance with any boys
except for    this crazy line dance that was really fun
you go like three steps    forward, turn around, go three steps back, repeat
and then jump in,    jump out, switch, and repeat
then the "girls" move one person forward,    and the whole thing starts over again with new partners
which reminds me
you never taught me how to dance
honestly maris
god
oh and i'm the most like you out of us three Delucca brothers
i get up    at a decent time
usually
i also
dont really sleep that well anymore, so if you rang the doorbell    i'd actually wake up
i used to be like a rock
but that's mostly over
and plus
my house has basically permenant open-ness
so you could really come over whenever you feel like
they never want me to be at someone elses    house for dinner
i guess its a little rude, but i dont really know)     we had practice today at 9 too, so i was almost up
you'd be so proud of me
after i got back from tori's party, i called    matt and dave back to tell them i was going to practice (instead of my    usual
maybe    later
like when i forget" or even my "well, if i dont call back, i dont    have to go to practice
so i called her like a    responsible person, and told her that us boys were having practice at 9,    but i'm not sure what the hell girls wanted to do (because girls deserve    the use of the H-E-
word)     and she was like "thanks
our total score was 27
so Jen got 8th     wait
does that add up
hmmm     yeah it does     i think     call me stupid if i'm wrong     girls won it for us in the co-ed title
cuz us boys kinda stink
o well     i did
alright-ish
not really     like i got a good time (11:07) and a semi-decent place (48) but i really    wasn't into it
like i wasn't really racing my hardest
i was just    running it like a casual workout
i really didn't care a lot
that's basically how i've been feeling about X-C lately
because i know    i'm not going to get a scholorship or anything for it
and i'm about    100x faster than i ever thought i could be (so
who cares if i get any    faster
so, theres not a lot of point to it, but i keep showing up and giving my    90%
i dont know how you managed to give 110% for two years before    breaking down
i mean Eric gives about 150% every day (from what i've seen at least) and    he's not getting beastly fast
so why not give him my speed     or give you my knee
its really not very fair
but that's life i guess
sorry if this depresses you, but then maybe you'll want a hug :P     remember
the butt stretch is my favorite stretch
because you get to hug your knee

Eastern Daylight Time                |    +------------------------------------------------------------------------+     Marissa, this is why we are lovers     so you can give and receive love
AND, not feel guilty about it unless you're official with someone else
when you find another boyfriend, things will get complicated, but until    then, we're lovers
btw, fedor was REALLY fun to dance with
i never knew she had an amazing    body
i dont think she enjoyed it nearly as much as i did, because about    5 seconds after we stopped dancing she ran away
that's ok tho
and ummm     about that kissing thing
well, see, that's called toying with you, and hoping i get lucky     you didn't kiss me you jerk     god
well, sorry for messing with you, but i was really enjoying myself
and be sure to warn people about dating me
i'm sure its not so fun with    all my
sideways thoughts and random games
They're always fun for me though
especially when you played back :P           btw, you were at Tori's party for all of 20 minutes
and it was mostly about how everyone wonders what i'm going to do    without you
there were wayyyyy too many girls at that party
things like this    happen)     it wasn't anything bad so dont worry
really           so i'll see you around
hopefully you wont bring up the fact that i    sometimes make an ass out of myself     +---------------------------------------------------------+    |---------------------------------------------------------|    | Subject: | Re: when things were simpler                 |    |----------+----------------------------------------------|    | Date:    | 9/14/2006 8:41:05 P

net writes:     I like dream about running every night and I think on how much fun I'm    missing
haha, you dream about running
that's kinda sad, because i dream about    you for the same exact reasons :P     and btw, christian was out for the entire season, except for like 2 meets    and came back to beast at sectionals
so you'll probably be fine
btw, if you work too hard, you'll hurt yourself
like i did
when you get healthy again
dont sprint up hill after the rest of the    boys team when your legs are already burned out
and then dont put in 2    minute surges every 10 minutes or so to try and catch up
especially on hard and curvy surfaces
so
i didn't do the workout
i went there, jogged an extra mile so i    didn't feel like a HUGE loser, and then the coaches wouldn't let me do any    more
and then i rode back to the school in Zalot's truck
and dont worry, i dont know anyone who hates you/ thinks you're an    ass
you could find a bunch who    have that opinion about me, but you're cool, so dont worry
i dont have as much homework as you
in fact, if you took four of me
you'd still be doing more work than    those four of me
and then, if you took two weeks of those four guys
it would be about    two days of your work
sometimes, i really worry about you
i mean, you're most likely to    become rich and famous, and then have a nervous breakdown
Anyway, what Frosh did you go to the barbeque for
did i tell you the story about this
basically, someone invited me and i    forgot who it was, and which club, so i asked to be on the swim team    patrol
YOU didn't join swimming
jerk     :P           oh and if by friends with tori, you mean going to her party, the answer    is
i dont have a gift for her, so i dont really want to just show    up
If i can pull something out of a hat, then you can expect me to be    there
and if not, i'll probably show up with a really wimpy looking    envelope
i am really tired
and i've noticed recently  that i'm literally too    lazy to think
so that's not good     this is probably a good sign that my running season has already peaked
instead of going to sleep
so bye bye
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the    truth
No, your honor
Why not
Because the prosecution is going to ask me yes or no answers
And
And "yes" is not the whole truth
Look, either swear in, or get down and stop wasting my time
I'll swear in
Did you assault these officers
Yes, but I don't agree with the implications of the word assault
Assault carries heavy connotations
Not only legal ones, but that my    offenses against them carried malice or an intent to harm in any way
What's more accurate is necessitated physical contact
But then again,    that doesn't sound like much of a crime
That's the same thing as assault
No, it's not
And you're the ones who asked me for the whole truth
No
actually that was the bailiff
You're the one who's so hung up on    giving the whole truth
Whatever
Hypocrite
Anyway, it's not like I really wanted to hit them, but they were in my    way, and there was no way to ensure I would be able to get around them, so    I decided to go through them
And why did you need to get through them
Because I had to leave the area before more cops showed up
So, you hit the officers to evade arrest
Yeah, that's a bit more accurate
And you've plead "not guilty" to evading arrest and assault on officers
Yes
Are we done here
Yes
Attention LUKE     If you turn on my computer, and plan on leaving it alone for a while,    change the power settings to "Power Saver"
It'll darken the screen after 1 minute, saving power
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, it uses less of the CPU, and will not get hot
Hot    compy=not good
Also, my brother's screen broke from over-use
because    he has his set to never darken, and never sleep
My sleep doesn't work right
so don't worry about it
Also, I forget to do this a lot of times too, so it's not a huge deal
Ok
That's it for now
I feel bad for mooching off your computer all the    time, but I just want to thank you for letting me use it
I'll be sure to    keep the computer on power saver
I turned it off because I was watching    Heroes and I guess I forgot to switch it back
Many, many apologies
My    computer should be fixed soon hopefully, but until than I'll be sure to    keep your computer like this
Thanks again
I owe you big time

com/jeffrey63090/     Bored Like Me     Foreword and Notes     "the only reason this entry is so long is because i dont want idiots like    you reading it
or Jeffrey63090@aol
com email or IM    me if you want     well, if you're my friend then u should know because occasionally i'll    tell you little details about it and thats that
its basically a big    project to be released later as a book with thoughts and actions of my    life and would be to entertain the massive hoards of people who think too    much for their own good, figure stuff out because they are way too smart    for their own good and are finally settling down and becoming bored, like    me
Foreword(s)    Ah, the realm of the unknown
It creeps upon us like a hideous mold that    waits for the next victim to crawl into it's insideous grasp
You see, I'm    just a regular person, with many dreams of the rest of the world
When i    was dreaming up this nice long 2-3 page foreword this is what it looked    like
They say to write what you know, but they say a lot of things
And what if    all that you know is fiction and fantasy novels
What if the things you're    writing aren't really as imaginitive and exciting as you think they are
I    go by my own philosophy of "if it isn't fun to write, then it isn't fun to    read
Where else would we get the inspiration and drive    to do things, if nobody else tells us to, even if that is just something    that is inside our heads
Well, then if there is something out there    making me tick; then thats just fine and dandy
For some, inspiration is    the thing they get to write a report 5 minutes before it is due
For me,    it's drawing upon the last person to dot thier i's and cross their t's on    the same topic as me, and just follow thier every move exactly
Who knows,    maybe im a creative genious, maybe im some kind of shaman, or maybe just    an overimaginitive kid with nothing better to do
Or, maybe, im just    phycho
It's not as long or as cool as i thought it would be
UPDATED
10/27/04    SOMEhow, im not quite surprised that its been that long
dont go to highschool- its not worth it
so far, i've lost ALL personal    relationship-except the dramatic scary ones (i fear
suddenly everything i've ever had pride in, had been crushed,    ground, and refined to a more materialistic form
to me, my writing was a    beautiful gift, something priceless in its uniqueness
now, all i see, is    garbage
theres nothing left in it but "quality" and "productivity" and    has undergone a mosterous transformation
Everything else has followed suit
BTW, the last update- that whole thing got me flamed beyond belief, and    ruined someone's life
then it got back to
normal
only got singed from that fire- i was lucky
another thing EVERYONE knows, but needs to be pointed out simply- love has    too much drama, i used to be so sad that i wasnt loved- now i'm caught up    in it
I love it- its like smoking pot- makes you high, makes you low, and    its constant fear of getting caught    NOT that i have any experience with that
UPDATED
9/18/04    im working on a very secretive project
its very secretive
it    involves a very heartfelt letter, and a LOT of self doubt
NONE OF YOU GET    TO SEE IT
its very private, and its about something that REALLY counts,    so i wont let anyone see it
in other news, today i added two shorts that interlock
they actually    were written one day apart
Life's great
A final note, the "much anticipated" release of the chain mail stories are    at the bottom
very spiffy
heh     Updated
2/4/04    Oh, has it really been that long
I started a new project-LGB(little green book) Chronicals
the Second Year
Its a complitation of short stories, but I wont realease it until this    summer because Its still too personal
teehee    right now i'm "wooing" someone special named C
S
Sylvia, this should bring back some "fond memories"    Just somethings I want to clear up for no reason at all, The only reason    im not talking to her anymore is because shes too beautiful
it blinds me
No, really, im a wuss
but we all know that already
another thing is that    no matter what anyone says, I still think that Lyricstime
com is still the    best lyrics page ever
Maybe sometime soon, Ill bring this up at my lunch    table, which was robbed of one of its more interesting members as I    accidentatlly pissed her off and she moved to the table where all the    girls used to sit
Conner sits there, and I hate him
Another thing that I think need to be cleared up is that whoever stole my    other LGB chronicals pages does not need to give them back because that in    itself give some humorous "make fun of the Idiot writer" material right    there
no, seriously, I want them back really
If you have them, you    shouldnt bring them back since im still pretty mad about that, even though    I have neither the strength or will to beat anyone up over papers, I'll    probably give you a dedications
that sound good
This space is reserved    to the guy who stole my LGB Chonicles manuscripts ____________
there
Updated
2/20/04    from now until i decide not to anymore, i will update every week day from    3-5 because thats when my brothers play My new game-Baulders gate 2
they're both grounded and hog the machine every chance so i usually go    online for some War3 action
but those days are over now    look at the very near bottom for my vote for the next while
Updated
2/21/04 the whole vote thing doesnt really work    no one really visits the site    i moved up the vote since some people are idiots
also, you email or    just tell me what you want     Updated
2/23/04    well, im trying my best to work on this on my free time
its not easy with    Baulders gate waiting to be beaten
i spread around the 2/20/04 and some Actsofgord
com stuff
There were    three types of people
1-its too long 2-hahahahaha 3-i hate you, and you    misspelled this word wrong-note, that this is the same grammar that they    use
i also added a    quotes section, which will stay there forever, no matter how many people    vote against it- so far i have three votes
Tom's idea is the best, but im just a tool of the peoples, tom
I cant    play favorites unless i really want to
Updated
3/1/04    happy belated leap year everybody
right now, im still not even close to finishing the most recent lgb    article
im also working on weeding out various extrodinarily odd errors in    spelling and/or grammatical errors, but i have little to none help since    no one even visits my website
I've decide that soon, like when im done with the article, ill delete    early conversations
If the title is still early converstations, its cause    im not changing it, but congratulations on noticing
Another thing im working on is Battle of Souls, which will in part take up    early conversations and will fully take up my mental focus and time
Email me if you get this far, and ill give you a dollar, if i remember,    and only then if you nag
and only then, if you remember that my saturdays 8-12 AM are holy, and    must never be desecrated
unless it really cant wait, or the cartoons are    all re-runs
and only then if they aren't good re-runs either
and only    then if th
nevermind, no saturday nagging
updated
3/21/04    lassie
just had to get that out of my system    since last time i did anything on this site, i've done a lot of thinking    and a lot of watching and i've noticed a lot of things
For one, i hate    the new font size aol is using
it sucks
for another, some of the people    i know are really good looking, and i've never really been one who cared    much about these things
Or, all of my friends were ugly, no offense
I    bet its me growing up
While doing just that is inevitable, and does have    some perks, I really don't like it at all
I have people nagging me to    shave, but that would admit defeat to the tiny hairs on my face
You can    barely see them through a magnifying glass, but people nag anyway
on the    other hand, not shaving too long would confirm my dislike of sharp pointy    things called knives, and would prove that the non-existant hairs are    there, thus proving that i'm growing up and care about looks
Another thing of profound importance, is that i cant find the famed time    traveler essay
thats bad
but on a positive note, i wrote "dark    imaginings" and will shortly write something not yet title
if you got this far, i have three things to say to you
Shame on you, go do something constructive
Congratulations, you got this far, you're not illiterate and are truely    "bored like me" thus proving my worth
You should email me, so i can confirm my own worth
thats about it, so i should either go to work or go to addictinggames
com    both are fine
maybe even imabigmoronwhocantrememberhislines
com    its a real site
On a final note for today, everybody read scott adams's Dilbert books
I    get most of my "original" material from him- its hilarious
Updated
5/11/04    If you are who you should be, then you know exactly when i say what i say
I try my best to reach out to people like me, but we're just to darn good    at hiding
I feel so alone, mostly because i'm afraid
I don't really know    of what, but right now i'm not trying to make anthing happen, just sitting    by myself waiting
Updated
6/9/04    to tell the truth, i wasnt that shocked to see that my last update was    nearly a month ago
if any of you need a new definition (actually an example
Dorkwad DeLucca- thats me, got a perfect 100% on his first    marking period grade on science
then, he goes practically lights the room    on fire, and his average mysteriously drops by 25% in the fourth marking    period
as in, i have no chance of getting an a, b, and willl mostly    likely miss the C mark
the whole thing is explained in a LGB entry for today, so why don't you    scroll to the bottom
AOL keeps changing my fonts against my will
Updated
8/9/04    ok this isnt really an update, because im a lazy slacker and spend most of    my time over the summer napping or nothing
oh, and this one time i    wrote up a bunch of random things that STILL arent finished
the reason    im writing this today, is that its just amazing how alike my brother and I    are
just go to his xanga website, hes YOURFACE321 by the way, it'll be    at the links at the bottom
anyway, every word is exactly, and facinatingly exact im talking, like    blow your mind out creepy, my own
in real life too
the most recent note    of this, im looking at a box of snowcaps, and i see- "semisweet Chocolate    Nonpareils"    normally i'd think "mmmmmm sno-caps
another thing is his girlfriend was about to    show us a Doctor Quinn Medicine Woman video, so i look at the back of the    box to see what its about
everyone looks at me all funny and notes    that about 20 minutes earlier my brother asked that same exact question
just saying is all, but thats freaky
UPDATED
9/4/04    i got a new website    i dont plan to do much work, with school and whatnot, but i do plan on    doing some fun writing, and passing it around for all to see
during this    summer, a conversation was passed about, that told all the goldman    stories
I hope to find the time to adapt it to one website or another
also, this ADD story came from a mail from a close friend of mine    thats going around too
everybody-eagerly await the release of those
NOW
________________________________________________________________________     ________________________________________________________________________     ________________________________________________________________________     ________________________________________________________________________     Shorts- like pants only shorter     this used to be the "early conversations" section    i had a vote that nobody participated in, so i got rid of it 4-0 votes    now im putting short stories in
there is an exeption- CHEAP LAUGHS
i mean- come on, without them, would we ever be laughing at a book,    looking like crazy looneys
NO, unless
you are a crazy loony, which    would explain why you're on my website
I think something to do with that    is also going to the random obsessions i have with self destruction
If    that sentance didnt make sense to you
feel proud: YOU ARE SANE    i love it when i can just slip into a mood, where whatever is thought, is    written
the only thing slowing me down, the only impedement- my brain    thinking structure, and my hands being too free
If i never hit the    "backspace button" i would have an incoherant slather of writing
i think    its better that way, because it give my brain something to do when im    trying to write
BRAIN, you arent wanted, go away
think about it, when has your brain ever done anything but get you in    trouble
if you DO have a situation that it saved you, its only because it    felt guilty for getting you in that situation in the first place
honestly, who likes brains
they're disgusting
they look like sponges
only more liquidy
or so im told, theres no way    to tell anyway
why do they call it "grey matter
i think that might be it, i might have to look it up sometime
i love love    its loving    lol, i think its funny how i can say that when it ruins my life, but its    still great
without some degree of love, i wouldnt have any friends, i wouldnt feel    guilt- which is the only thing keeping me from doing the wild things that    pop into my head- and i would never get those natural highs that i've been    well noted for
even though, on the other hand, its really the only thing known to get me    down, but my astrology said that would happen    i dont care if its fake or not, but its not like anyone decided- ill make    up a whole fake system based on the stars so that people can benefit for    it LATER
its basically like all the math and science stuff we have built up over    the years- its an explination of things that happen
just a bunch of    notes on whats usually going on
i believe it, its the interpreting and applying of it that gets crazy
its    like
say a sport
you can get better through practice and coaching, but    sometimes you just need a gift for it
theres no way that i can be thinking of what i was thinking
its just    wierd    ok- is love just perpetual thinking of someone, or is it a pure, raw    emotion, like pain
it can be dulled, but its still there all the same
i think its an emotion, because thats what i've been taught by writers,    friends, and basically all the random background knowledge i've built up    over the years
but something tells me
it cant be that
is it even possible to just    flow to that same thing, over and over
to FEEL them
i dont know, its    such a wierd thing
love might be anything, who knows
but all i know, is that theres    something
it makes me think, and think, and think
and thats what love is for
its natures way of telling us, we're only    human, we are BOUND to humanity, we have nothing except for that
its the one emotion that cant be controlled
anger-yes, pain- yes, but    love- will haunt you forever
it feels like im always exaggerating these things, but its wierd, because    when i look back, thats all i remember
just that constant thought, of    her
The girl of my dreams
Every night its    different, but its still the same
She's still burningly desirable, still    in that tomboyish, stuck-up way, but always the same attraction
I think I still dream her for just the feeling
The feeling of love, of    power and lust
The feeling of feeling
The mind ages quicker than the    body it seems, or else I would have no need for such dreams
The mind    outgrew physical feelings in just 12 years, but the body still feels them    stronger than ever
It's the way life shows us inadequacies
That's what    separates us from everything else I guess
Im just so tired by now
Aged too far past ripening in youth, the price of    humanity
What is it that changes us so
Why am I doomed to keep the ruse    of youth if I can see past at first glance
Can I be tired of being happy
I love the first feeling of meeting someone new
That's always the same,    always perfect
I even use the same one on every person
First shyness,    then wait
Waiting for attention never takes long like that
Then just    slowly look up an smile
Like a secret shared between lovers, complete    happiness so that even the eyes gleam beyond all defences
Everybody wants    that happiness, because it always works
Then slowly the secrets leak,    showing a never ending maze into the soul, charm making both the bait and    trap
Ensared I am, every night
But bound to me is she, or else what of the    dream
But what is this love thing
This feeling I get every night but in    complete void in the daytime
Where is it now
We'd all just kill    ourselves and that would be the end of it
I am a firm believer in three    things, if nothing else
Love, Magic and Fate
I guess its because so much    of my life is coincidence
Coincidence is the most amazingly awesome thing; both in the very cool    way, as well as the shockingly powerful, awe-inspiring thing
Here's one    that just happened last night and coincidentally includes two of the three    things I believe in
I wrote the very sad beginning to this story, ending with "where is it    now
He needed to    buy a plane ticket to my house for part of the summer, and we previously    had little contact with him
One of his friends(Becca), starts talking to    me
She hasn't been to my website yet
Promising she will I, cheerily urge    her on, where she notes: You're very happy
Remembering back to what I    just wrote, I tell her its not so true, and send her my story as proof
Very impressed, it is found that she is DE-pressed as well
My halfway    gothic, story partly about rejection, helps her on her way as she    describes how she feels
After meeting one time, im halfway in love, and very happy
YAY
But in the end, isn't that we all want-perfection in someone else
But why, we all ask, would someone perfect want some dopey kid like me
Well, tell me, just one reason, that you aren't perfect
Perfect for someone like me
Am I perfect for someone like you
Sometimes I don't know, and sometimes I don't want to know
I always torment myself with the if and whys for everything insignificant,    but then jump ahead into the thing that I can't handle
Don't ask why, I'm just as lost as you are, probably
If I had all the answers, I wouldn't need someone perfect like you
Tap tap tap    Back and forth, the rhythmic beating taking me to a far off place and    back, within the blink of an eye    Pacing, before dawn
Those heavy booted feet bringing the plans of    tomorrow, the siege
He could imagine the horrors of the next day, the    battle cry of the demented souls as they came into view
The screech of    the mutilated undead as they climbed up to fight their once brethren
Multitudes of them, as the plagued scouts had seen
They would not be    stopped until the last of the lkiving had been demented to their cause
So    he paced
The soft rustle of his cloak masked the quiet, secretive motions    of another
Sneaking up, behind, following the very breath of the soon to    be prey, follower braced to leap, and
A sudden cry brings me back
Another follows, but the pacing continues, this time a harsh insult    follows it
I brace for his attack, and count down from 3    2    1    Right on time, the other spins me around, gripping to the floor with a    slight duck, I fist hands and prepare for another attack
Only an insult follows, and I return to the incessant pacing
My focus lost, I look around in gloomy silence
Where once was silence and    solitude there is now the din of Childs play
I paced on, more careful of    the floating bodies flung across the room
Grinning happily as the lock slowly clicks open and swings quietly open    another entered, the gentle pacing filled the room
Snickering softly,    knowing all to well what would happen soon, he masked his own light    footfalls in the heavy booted ring of the other
The pacer was turning, so    the follower made a wide arc, careful as not to be even close to being    seen
The footsteps merged as the two came slowly closer and closer
the    follower braced to leap and grabbed out the staff both weapon and shield,    tool and creation
he leaped up, and grabbed onto a long thin strand of    magic
Wrapping the sticking line around his hands, the follower twisted    them into a complex web of invisible strands and pulled hard
he felt it    wrap around his victim's, and immediately became distinctly aware of    something wrong
Twisting in midair, a distinguished movement came over    him
The invisible web of energy slowed to a stop, dormant, but not    entirely gone
the victim was instantly alert and threw off the web, no    longer cought in its call and the follower dodged right to avoid the    pacer's attack
A shadow flew up the hardwood surface and crawled up my body
I became    conscience of a flying object and tracked it's shadow for it's direction
It flew into a net with a soft whoosh
My focus further deteriorated, I made a conscience effort to bring back    the dark imaginings of a borrowed dream
another sat silently in a small, comfortable chair, legs propped up on the    armor he would wear into battle the next day
He sat borededly, watching    the couriers come in and out, fully intending to drink the night away, but    by the time he finished his first, the constant pacing shushed him to    sleep
still dosing, he awoke to see a figure creeping, silently sneaking    up on an unsuspecting victim
he prepared to attack and the watcher    noticed the summoning of magic
Reacting instantly, he imdubed a dagger    with a counterspell and lauched it toward the assassin
leaping out of his    chair behind the attacker and smoothly hefting a rather large battle axe,    the watcher smiled to himself, knowing exactly what was about to go on
Feeling the crackle of magic, I whirled around and saw two figures
the    one closest to me was attempting to cast a phasing spell, which would    bring me falling through the floor
Another was swinging a wide arc in the    air
A knife was flinging toward the spellcaster, obviously imbuded with    some kind of counterspell, and was about to kill my follower
I    immediately flashed out a hand and effortlessly snatched it out of the air    and sent it launching toward the battle axe about to crush me
the    counterspell stopped, the weilder of the battle axe was unexpectantly    flying through the wall
Snatching him up by the feet, i was dragged with    him though the floor and into another's living quarters
It was oddly    covered with strange vines that cought us both up and immediately stopped    our unexpected flight
Earth abosorbes magic
such was life, draining the    only power left until only the core elements remained
And what of Void, i    dismally thought
What of the enemy awaiting the dawn, for the seige on    this very castle
Oh castle, real original jeff
The thoughts are silent as the startaling    realization of wrongdoings are made apparent
Whenever i characterize myself in my head
there are alway at least five
Void, Life, Good, Bad (Rage), and Neutrality
in doing this, i can assign    names to emotions and list the blame of myself onto another
I imagine    that there is a history to them, and tried once to make of an ancient    setting to them, needless to say, it was about as orginal as the writing    above
the introduction of myself as a viewer of that past never happens    in real life, whether in a dream or daytime imagining
there is no real    void, life, etc
but i use them to characterize the world around me and    the feelings within
this being said, you all know more about me than you    ever thought you would
Over time, they usually shift names as i grasp a    new, or firmer understanding of the world as i grow
Not me
Not now, you should say
When you're half the age of a highschool senior, you dont need to care
When you're the happy-go-lucky fourth grader, these things dont matter
When the world looks down and pities you, you know that you need to open    you're eyes, and not before then right
When you're too young to know what politics are, and too delighted at    everything, you'll never be alone
When you're just sober enough to    realize that you were wrong give me a call
When you get back from you're    long tour of popularity and get clean from the powerful drug of happyness,    come pay me a visit
When the lies of the "friends" who don't care are    finally deciphered, come to my room
It's not very clean, and there's no    one around but me
Just me and myself
Just me and and endless stack of    stories that only I have the time to read
Just me and my wild    imagination
Just me and this paper and this pencil, writing and hoping
Writing and hoping that you'll come
that reason will be revealed in the first few quotes by me     -i am but a simple man who would like to but help others, who are "bored,    like me"
thats not very good for humanity as a    whole
Jessamyn West- Writing is a solitary occupation
Family, friends, and    society are the natural enemies of the writer

And this time, they cant hurt me either
No, really that's a good thing     -Minimize casualties, maximize fun     -like i said maybe three times in my lifetime
I love the    stench of delay
ok maybe it is
we love you jeff, just not in that way
Its just that i think like one
sometimes, i send people my stories over the internet
and then get    impatient 30 seconds later and start asking them if they like it, if i    should change anything, if they're as hungry as me
if they like it    now

2/20/04    Mr
s Maleh <----lol anyway
mrs maleh stole my original entry for this    day because i was writing it during my spainish class when we were going    over this test that i aced
be proud of me my humble readers- you wish you    could be me
now, i will return to my normalness and continue on with salvaging my    wounded pride since my once perfect beginning was ruined
I'll try to    salvage it
Ah, theres nothing like the neglect of a personal project
I love the    stench of delay
Its been so long since i even had the time to document    all that has been going on lately
the condition of my relationship (what    relationship
S
has been rapidly deterorating
Void killed    everyone, and Neutrality is back in control
Ive discovered that too many    people know me for me to consider myself a loser anymore, but i still feel    like it
right now, the spainish teacher hates me
Even as i'm writing    this shes screeching at Charlie about his posture
Since i have    a lot of time ill just tell you how this day is going, since ive had a    very interesting morning
It started at 6:30, as usual, but
Heres where Mrs
Maleh stole my paper
Ill just continue from where i left    off
as usual, but soon it came extrodinarily apparent that this would be no    usual day
this day would belong to the one person it would truely belong    to
Good    yes, this would be the day of Good and as such i would have tons of fun    swinging along in his wake of self incurred havoc and distruction
it really wasnt all his fault
the previous night i firmly decided that i    would 1)not shave until i really needed it and 2) wear the same clothes    until I got home Monday, or felt like it
dont ask
well, soon after my awakening, my mom comes running into my room saying    something like "look at all those deer
she looks out
I soon    after grab my glasses (somthing hard to do if you're glasses are behind of    you on a tall nightstand covered in all sorts of would-be treasures i find    in my pockets at the end of the day) and go to the window
of course a second before i get there they start running off
My mom    plows through me and rushes to her room where the deer are headed outside    of
i follow her slightly less enthusiasticly- hey, im a new jerseyite now,    deer are "everywhere"
sure enough a bunch of fat ugly deer wonder about our neighbor's lawn
yay
i dont think so
later when im fixing myself up, i decide- hey maybe i should go ahead and    make myself look good today
i put in some weird spray and apply some stridex zit stuff
both of these,    as i soon discover, are not exactly the most funnest stuff to have all    over you head
when stridex says "maximum strength" they dont kid around
i applied what    some would call liberally- and my face was suddenly and unexpectantly    shrinking
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
i checked the box and sure enough it said- some shrinking of head may be    expected    well at least they tell you    then directly below that, it says-in some cases, nausea, diarrhea, and    bubonic plauge may occour
in rare cases explosion of head may occour
hey
have you ever checked one of those warning lables
anyway, that spray stuff is ok, but it leaves all this gunk in your hands
just rinse jeff, theres nothing to be afraid of
breakfast went as usual, but upon getting to school things seemed    different    jazz band was
fun    wow, thats unusual    the day really started getting to LA    I had just realized that i forgot my backpack in the band room, so i asked    crigel if i could get it
suddenly, a great idea sprang into my head
act    punk and evil for the entire day
I confided to Megan A
that I would
Mario, just behind her decides that the whole world revolves around him    and calls out to me- Delaware, you suck    uhhh
ok Maria, i mean mario    he pins me against the wall and hits me in the stomach    Megan starts laughing her brains out and they drip onto the floor    so now we have me, held up by my neck on the wall, and Mario is beating    the crap out of me
Megan went comatose in a puddle of her own brains and    people gather around us for gangbeating and/or shoveling Megan's "grey    matter" back into her head
It's a mess
Even the brilliant Alex G
was losing it
no, thats not even close to what happened, but if you want it to then skip    the next few lines
_______________________________    crigel thinks its time for me to actually start going to get my backpack    and sends me off
thats it
_________________________________________    well, i sneak into the band room and gather it up before Mrs
Phillips    notices that im an idiot
i decide to pick up a pencil on the way back so that i can just skip going    to my locker until after the period
Upon arrival the guests had all stared, dripping wet and clearly depressed    he headed straight for the stairs, no longer cool but a boy in a stich    unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships
thats not what was really happening, just a song that sort of reminded me    of me in a strange kind of way
i walk up to what appeared to be a very confused and distressed crigel
Hi, uh, what are we doing
Well, im just spinning in circles not getting any work done
she shoveled a few colorful bits of paper into the large bag that    contiually sits upon her cart and turns to me
oh, right you are getting into groups and making a wordsearch out of your    made up greek/latin words
I attempt to approach my would-be desk, but alas, my backpack is still    resting upon my spine, quite painfully if i remember correctly
By now, the backpack was swinging down from my arm to be stuffed in the    corner of the room
I didnt quite throw it far enough so i did the only    thing that came to mind
I kicked it as hard as i could
Ah, Curly, you    inspire us
well, I did the three stooges thing (gee are you slow
good for comedic    action
bad for, uhh, footness
Shut up its a word
Name calling and laughing ensue as i hop about like an dork who just    smashed thier foot on a backpack and moved it an inch
Here it really gets    good
If you want this story done, you'd better email me before the end of    Feburary
there's a LOT more to it than this
like my "puppydogging" with    Kristen, and the Megan/Kristen incident and Spainish Shenagens as    mentioned in the begining
if you dont, nothing will be done- never say    never to Gord, i mean, Jeff
i'm a failure
I caved in after a day- im just so bored
I'll delete this    whole thing later, maybe after someone actually comes to my website     So then, I shout out the entire world- WHO WANTS TO BE MY PARTNER
Hey dufus, Mrs
Rigel, er
crigel says, you're working with the people    around you
But, but
they're mean
she looks at us like we're some kind of retarded chipmunks who just stole    candy from her purse
Megan mutters    <sob, i think i'll cry in the corner
its too painful>    Jeff, you arent working with us
Evan says    Yeah, ok, but
Oh crap, we are
the entire period commences with me acting like a total fool-what else is    new- and then we all say Delaware-go away    so im on my way to band looking at the ground before my feet, as i usually    do, and kristin T
with her really nice-ness comes up to me and she's like    "whats wrong Jeff
uh oh, as im writing this i feel guilty    i cant go on    im such a bad person    whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<hic hic>     4/21/04    I've done some things that I'm not exactly proud of, but some things I    don't have control over either
I don't know if it's just a part of me    that I can't get rid of, or just a part of me that i name as something    else and pass the blame
What I do know is that this is an apology
And a    flyer for my website
Wherever you are when you read this, please don't sit down and cry
Or    hunt me down and gang beat me all at once
Or do anything that you would    have liked to do
Just think of me
Nobody can help me, but    everybody feels this way
I'm not used to being alone
And I wouldn't wish    it on anybody, now that I know what it feels like
I thought briefly of    just disappearing from all of you, so that I could leave you be and not be    missed
But, we all know, or at least I know, that I can't keep away from people,    and can never keep a straight face for more than five minutes
And I know    that I can't change my very soul to reflect anything close to the evil    unhappy person I wanted to appear as
If I were able to do all those things, I would abuse my already bad name,    and just slip through the cracks
It would be so easy
Just look like a    druggie and just fall out of reality
I wish I knew if anybody would try to help me, but Maybe we are all just    like me
Afraid
If someone I knew was using, I couldn't do anything about it
We all make    some choices that others don't like, and we all wish we didn't when we get    past it
If you feel like just dropping to your feet, then do it
Surrender to the world and get it over with
Take the easy path, and drip    into the sewers like you never existed
Who would notice
This wasn't meant to be a drug speech, but an apology
I feel like I've    done something wrong, and I feel guilty
But to me, it all seems so    distant
Like it never happened
What happened to me, I wonder, that I never noticed my own wrongs but only    noticed the hurt
It feels like a weight around my body, but I cant get    rid of it
And in a way, I'd rather live with the guilt, than live with getting away    with everything
I think I'd rather slip through the gaps of society than    slip through my own guilt like a wet, heavy shirt, threatening to sicken    me
I think that if I take off that guilt, I'll change, and become even worse    than before
So guiltless, that I can't even feel that somehow I just hurt    you
So, apology accepted
I hope not
4/28/04    Its the little ironies that i see in all of life that makes things    interesting for me
One day, i set out to get all of them written down
Theres too many of them for anybody to even do in one day
some are more obvious than others
I dont even remember most of them
today a lunch, we all noticed Tommy was less than present
so kristen says    "hey Tommy's not here" and i think-oh i bet everyone will turn and finally    notice me, and the next second, kristen turns to me and says "how you    doing Jeff
Like for    example, is my capitalization of letters one random enactment or is it    some wierd bias
Kristen is not capitalized, except for right here
Is it    because she's a girl or because i'm more familiar with her
Or maybe Im    just lazy
but my name is always capitalized
Oh, and im always proud of myself for some reason
theres really no reason    for me to proud of myself i dont think
Lisa hates me for being such a big    meanie, and she calls a certain person "dirty man" whenever she sees him
and i can do the belly dance
oh yeah look at the fat go
I'm not that fat, im just not skinny
well, not stick skinny like other    people-does that creep anybody else out
that some people are like sticks
anywho, I copy practically everything i
e
that anywho in the beginning of    this sentence from the simpsons
My "unique" writing style comes from a    mix of all the books i've ever read
and i think somewhere i wrote that    the words come from "the spirit of the past"
or something like that
Oh and another thing is that one time when i was writing to prove that im    not completely random, and someone was like- why in hell would you do    something stupid like that
and then i was like uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
because by disproving that i was random, i had committed another random    act
I added on a feeble disprovement to that, and now it is cleared for    all eternity, or until that paper rots away
I'm sure that if you look hard enough, or at least read half of the stuff    i write, you could find something thoroughly original and witty, but    probably forget it the next day, and my would-be fame gets completely    destroyed in the recesses of your memmory
5/4/04    We are all hopelessly addicted to one thing or another
Otherwise, we just    wouldnt be human
For many it may be cigarettes or even technology
For    some, it's love
I used to be addicted to love
Now, i'm hopelessly    addicted to finding something
Nothing feels quite right anymore, and i    dont think its just me
maybe something big is changing, and im just lost    in the midst
5/11/04    Do you ever feel like you're trapped in your own body, in your own life
All the time
Lost in some joke gone bad played by myself
I think two of    the most important things for life, besides the capacity to love, are the    abilities to blame and to believe
You cant block things out of your head,    but you can give it a name and believe that it's for the better
But is it    enough to just keep chugging along, or is there some purpose to do
I'm    really tired
I'm sick of all this
well, i'm screwed
before i acutally start, i think i'll give a bit of    background on me, atwal and the mysterious C
S
Atawal is a boy living on    my street and going to my school and in my grade
very strange
oh and    he has the most important student council position next year-treasurer
we're loosing lots of money, so he should be a freaking genious next year,    but alas, we're doomed now
CS is christine Sca-n-- with random lettters dashed out 1) because i    forget how to spell it, and 2) because she has absolutely no idea that    she's on my website (in several places actually)
once i tried to tell    her, but that was after the incident about to be described, so she was    more than a little PO'ed and ripped up the original copy of one of the    entries
I used to like her, but she's not my type, i
e
ditsy blonde    albiet charming
moving on
6/9/04    Well, well
I'm in some trouble with Goldman eh
well, she'll see how i    deal with people i
e
www
geocities
com/mikepersak/pink    heheheh    I SEND THEM TO AN INTERNET DOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
ahem, moving on
wow i'm beat, writing this isnt as fun as it should be
i apologize if    its boring you *yawn
well, it might not be, but who    cares
the point was for the rest of you to watch my comma action and    learn about what happened the night of the eighth grade dance
anyway, so we kick it on the dance floor, but im in suit
so I JUST    STAND THERE    right, so anyway, to go back a little, i mean, in time, i didnt moonwalk    or anything, i'm just doing a flash back    theres something funny in my quotes section of my website about    flashbacks, go there now
anyway, im flashing-ewwwwww    back-ohhh
flash back -in case you couldnt tell    Setting: im in the car with my bad dad    im making fun of him for not living up to his bad dad reputation and    driving me    there are two big bundles of people    one, closer to me, is all of the "pimpin' guys" further off is the girls,    and boys that are *real pimps* as they hang out solely with girls
all the    gay kids are with the pimpin' boys, obviously
seriously, what gay kid    would want to hang out with girls
or at least manly men, who can tell these days
right so flashback dad says, "where should i drop you off
so i'm like, "ill get off here, cuz im one of the pimps"    i jump out of the window, tuck, and roll as his monster truck rolls over    the rest of the crowd    thankfully only ugly single dads were hurt
the crowd immediately notices, "HEY, ITS DELUCCA,    and hes pinmpin'
heres one of the big differences between girls and boys, other than i    noticed that girls were better looking    the crowd immediately notices, "HEY, ITS DELUCCA,    and his hair is flat
bi o-organic lifeform
ohhhhhhhhhhh, burn
anyway, flashing forward to where i'm just standing around, something    tragic happens
this girl Racheal C
starts attacking me    im sure i deserved it but i forget why
so as she turns around, i poke her in the back, intending to stab her with    my long, pointy
fingernails
any of you who expected PENIS are sadly mistaken- oops there    it is     anyway, fate has it that right where i strike her, happens to hold an    intruiging object beneath her shirt
intruiged, i poke it again, and figure out exactly what it was    "oh
eww     she whips around and starts attacking me screaming YOU SICKO, that one i    really deserved
nervous and afraid, i run away and get several free drinks and some    crunchy thing wrapped in bacon
it was good
while im sitting enjoying my drink with a few friends that happened to be    there, an unlikely pair arrive by my side
Jessie LAZUR and Kristen Birdsie, well however you spell thier names
anyway, so they appear, both, by the way, looking absolutely FABulous
ok, now my masculine side is coming, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh    anyway so they're both drop dead gorgous,    well at least Birdsie is, Lazur is beautiful, and at least an inch taller    with heels
So i wave to them both and jessie holds out her hand
about to kiss it, i remember that im still a kissing "virgin" and that    we're not in a '60s movie    i take her hand and bow, to dance, yet another fine point of a sixties    movie    little do they all know, ive never SEEN a sixties movie    unless greese is one, and ive seen that at least three times    we do a little shuffle from side to side, when she unexpectedally spins    around
ok
ill play along
i do a very ungraceful spin, and she laughs openly at me
very sad, nearly heart broken, actually, i sit down and comment about how    little alcohol is in my drink, specifically none since i dont drink
the two girls i was sitting with note this, though i was sure i only    thought it, and say, "if you dont go
i mean, flashing back    ok, now its tuesday, or monday    who can tell anyway
HAHAHAHA    anyway, flashback jeff is hunched over a once clean napkin, that has black    permanant marker all over it now    the marker bleeds over the table revealing the works written on the    napkin
as the napkin goes in flashback jeff's pocket, the camera zooms in on the    blood on the table
give me a break, im trying to do creative workplay
THIS IS NOT A HIT LIST
the "master plan" was all of the people i was going to ask    ok ok, more names     Kristin Birdsey Laura Mraz    (lines from both converging on
ok so, ahem, right now we're in the gym (dancefloor) again, and im feeling    guilty, lonely, and i think im in love
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh    anyway, just kidding on the last one
hehe    no, she just laughs too hard, and this being a serious manner, i show    great self restraint and keep a straight face
am i being too hard on her    well it doesnt matter because nobody goes on my website to read it    anyway
as the only one laughing, jessie pulles herself together quickly    "anyway
umm
at the beginning of this week, well, not the beginning,    but it was monday, well, at lunch anyway
THE END
great story     7/30/04    I think that most of the problem is that I don't know how to handle    myself
To most of the people reading this, that probably seems like the    most obvious statement ever made by me
But seriously, I'm the most    boneheaded person I know
Here's a few examples
A long time ago, when I still was crushing on C
S
Problem is, I live in a fantasy world where    magically burning things is an everyday event when someone pisses you off
Really, what am I supposed to do if things inexplicably go perfectly as    planned in my head
So anyway, it was mentioned in passing that she hurt    her arm
Mostly I was doing the passing and she was doing the mentioning,    but I stopped every now and then to make fun of the fact that she worked    hard to get muscle, where I was happily weak to a 1st grade level
So the    plan was to push open that fat heavy door leading out of Spanish class
Just about to do that at the ring of the non-existent bell, I clumsily    trap myself into my own desk attempting to hurry up
Struggle with my    books for nearly a minute and look like a general idiot
Later I told her    that entire ordeal, making a good side conversation
See, its not really all my fault     This second one has been nagging me for quite a while now
In fact, its    been flat out stabbing me in the ass; coming back periodically to haunt me    or occasionally hunt me
Here we are, all of us
Just sitting, eating lunch, having little    conversations
Nothing out of the ordinary
Only thing is, two days    previous, Megan A
got a new haircut
I don't remember how she looked    before, but I noticed immediately when she got it, and noticed an    improvement
So anyway, my little interjection to the conversation is how    amazingly kewl konversation is
I go on about how longstanding my    (lol) complementing goodness has been, when all of a sudden people start    barking at me about my total ignorance to my own actions
Again, living,    like I do, in a fantasy world, I have no idea what they want from me
I    mean, the things that they say about me
Anyway, I
forget
but the point is that I said that it "looks like a    naked mole rat went up on your head and exploded
for all you slow readers out there
Obviously this was a very controversial statement, but in my own defence,    complements have to come to you, and since one didn't, I forced it, and    that's just plain stupid
wait
Then of course there was the whole rest of the year, and that was just    plain, all out, retarded on my part
Since I have SEVERAL hours to burn, I    figure that I can write the entire Goldman Chronicles, go back, revise    them, take a few "creative liberties" and still have some time left to    burn them if they really suck since I got tired halfway through
8/31/04    this is a truely interesting thing, and the order is kindof important,    along with a basic idea of what went on
I have some interesting friends,    lets just say that
the convesation with sylcat went first    then the "you are so wierd jeff
she wanted to know what was going    on
so i started telling her the story
i started off with a bunch of    informal summaries of the people involved, but i talked so much that the    top got cut off, so i couldnt get back to it
sad
we got this old style teacher    Jeffrey63090 [3:53 PM]: who expect utter and complete silece at all times    Jeffrey63090 [3:53 PM]: so quiet that you can hear the rats running about    in our walls    Jeffrey63090 [3:53 PM]: nobody needs that    Jeffrey63090 [3:53 PM]: so shes mean to us    Sylcat123 [3:53 PM]: lovely

ahem, moving on
Jeffrey63090 [3:58 PM]: It all begins with me and Atwal
One day it seems    we are doing an obnoxiously boring review with everybody misbehaving
Mostly it was not me, as I was on the brink of snoozing off in the back
Soon thereafter, and unfortunate chain of events lead up to my second    referral to the office
After quieting the crowd of unruly, and wide    awake,    Jeffrey63090 [3:58 PM]: students, Mrs
Goldman becomes fed up with the    group
Jeffrey63090 [3:58 PM]: "Do you want to do this individually, or as a    group" -she asks    A total and complete silence fills the crowd
Jeffrey63090 [3:59 PM]: "Ok
Apparently my right hand is disobedient to both Mrs
Goldman as well as myself, as it was the first to rocket into the air
Seeing as Atwal was closer, she refers to him first
Quieting my voice to    an almost in audible murmur, I continue with one of those great comebacks    that always go unused
After possibly three minutes of mind-numbing boredom and whining to each    other, we bring a new form of entertainment to the world
It wasn't    exactly smart, or new at all
In fact, every person who has asked me about    this event called me a retard, or at least stupid
Here's how it all went down
Jeffrey63090 [3:59 PM]: "Hey, there' a lot of space back here, know what    we could do
Jeffrey63090 [3:59 PM]: heres where the story finishes    Jeffrey63090 [3:59 PM]: but ill go on    Jeffrey63090 [3:59 PM]: when you finish    Sylcat123 [4:00 PM]: done    Jeffrey63090 [4:00 PM]: good huh    Jeffrey63090 [4:00 PM]: very tidy    Sylcat123 [4:00 PM]: yeah    Sylcat123 [4:00 PM]: nice wording    Jeffrey63090 [4:00 PM]: anyway    Sylcat123 [4:00 PM]: very good    Jeffrey63090 [4:00 PM]: so    Jeffrey63090 [4:00 PM]: i say    Jeffrey63090 [4:00 PM]: "we could put on a play back here

Sylcat123 [4:35 PM]: wait, was it the F **** or the H ****    Jeffrey63090 [4:35 PM]: "you know how many people could have been hurt    form this    Jeffrey63090 [4:35 PM]: h
Sylcat123 [4:35 PM]: ok, continue    Jeffrey63090 [4:35 PM]: but    Jeffrey63090 [4:35 PM]: shhhhhhhhhh    Jeffrey63090 [4:35 PM]: lol    Jeffrey63090 [4:35 PM]: ok    Jeffrey63090 [4:35 PM]: "if you get a lawsuit, do you know what could have    happened"    Jeffrey63090 [4:36 PM]: no    Jeffrey63090 [4:36 PM]: "you know who would have been blamed"    Jeffrey63090 [4:36 PM]: no    Jeffrey63090 [4:36 PM]: she goes on for a while like this    Jeffrey63090 [4:36 PM]: saying that she doesnt want to lose her job    Jeffrey63090 [4:36 PM]: from some dumb kid like me    Jeffrey63090 [4:36 PM]: what kind of teacher is this

Jeffrey63090 [4:37 PM]: rumor had it that the other science teachers got    very angry with her    Sylcat123 [4:38 PM]: heehee    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: and 3 out of 10 people i know    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: had their own little fires    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: lol    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: but none were punished    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: in fact    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: while i was being punished    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: someone else even had a fire going    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: but the class was focusing on me    Sylcat123 [4:38 PM]: hahahahahahahah    Jeffrey63090 [4:38 PM]: so nobody cared    Sylcat123 [4:38 PM]: can't

smiling    Jeffrey63090 [4:39 PM]: lol    Sylcat123 [4:39 PM]: :-D    Jeffrey63090 [4:39 PM]: try your best    Jeffrey63090 [4:39 PM]: my fingers kind of hurt    Jeffrey63090 [4:39 PM]: anyway    Jeffrey63090 [4:39 PM]: i wrote three formal apologies    Jeffrey63090 [4:39 PM]: my real science teacher got real pissed at me    Jeffrey63090 [4:40 PM]: most of my formal apologies were denied    Jeffrey63090 [4:40 PM]: (two)    Jeffrey63090 [4:40 PM]: and this became the "geek story of the year"    Jeffrey63090 [4:40 PM]: entering that category    Jeffrey63090 [4:40 PM]: for sheer use of the word "isopropanol"    Jeffrey63090 [4:41 PM]: which is a pretty funny word anyway    Jeffrey63090 [4:41 PM]: i might use it more often    Jeffrey63090 [4:41 PM]: anyway    Sylcat123 [4:41 PM]: hee    Jeffrey63090 [4:41 PM]: eventually    Jeffrey63090 [4:41 PM]: i was mostly forgiven    Jeffrey63090 [4:41 PM]: and instead of Failing that lab    Jeffrey63090 [4:41 PM]: 1/2 of the fourth MP grade    Jeffrey63090 [4:42 PM]: i got 75% credit    Jeffrey63090 [4:42 PM]: on a hypothetical one    Jeffrey63090 [4:42 PM]: but thing is    Jeffrey63090 [4:42 PM]: she promised i could get full    Jeffrey63090 [4:42 PM]: and wrote a comment that i did an exceptional job    on it    Jeffrey63090 [4:42 PM]: so thats ok anyway    Jeffrey63090 [4:43 PM]: seeing as i averaged out to a 90 in the end for    the year    Jeffrey63090 [4:43 PM]: (thats an A here
that means the other half of your grade was    105%    Sylcat123 [4:43 PM]: huh
Jeffrey63090 [4:43 PM]: no    Jeffrey63090 [4:43 PM]: in the end    Jeffrey63090 [4:43 PM]: not 4th MP    Jeffrey63090 [4:43 PM]: but all combined    Sylcat123 [4:43 PM]: ohhhhhh    Jeffrey63090 [4:43 PM]: then divided by 4    Sylcat123 [4:44 PM]: i see    Jeffrey63090 [4:44 PM]: o yeah, i got 100 on the first mp    Jeffrey63090 [4:44 PM]: lol    Sylcat123 [4:44 PM]: cool    Jeffrey63090 [4:44 PM]: so i went from 100    Jeffrey63090 [4:44 PM]: to like 82
Jeffrey63090 [4:44 PM]: something    Jeffrey63090 [4:44 PM]: good stories
Jeffrey63090 [4:44 PM]: good times
Sylcat123 [4:45 PM]: hmmm    Jeffrey63090 [4:45 PM]: good food
Sylcat123 [4:45 PM]: good    Jeffrey63090 [4:45 PM]: mmm    Jeffrey63090 [4:45 PM]: food    Sylcat123 [4:45 PM]: but slightly confusing, lol    Sylcat123 [4:45 PM]: i like your stories    Sylcat123 [4:45 PM]: they sound like things out of movies    Jeffrey63090 [4:45 PM]: but are true anyway    Sylcat123 [4:45 PM]: singing in the middle of class b/c you don't like the    teacher    Sylcat123 [4:45 PM]: awesome     ///some more background\\\    i was going to send the conversation to a close friend of mine, but you    know how girls are with keeping their feelings hidden and whatnot, so i    thought it safer to send the convo to a close friend of mine, who had    absolutely no idea who sylcat was
this way, she could look for hidden    messages before i sent it to the friend who knew exactly who sylcat was
soon enough the convo was spread a small bit, to many peoples
mostly my    fault
You, Jeff, are so weird
Then again, so is Mrs
Goldman
This made me crack up like mad
It also    brought up several old memories
I think, if I wasn't    so protective of my laptop, I would have fell off of    my chair laughing--just about
Hehe
Are you leeting
Jeff leets
Or Jeff doesn't leet
That is the question
Then again, there are probably a ton of other    questions
The problem is which question to ask
And which    question is THE question
Which do you think is THE question
Maybe it's
is cheese purple
Or, is there any truth in the K2K Harry Potter theory
I'm rather skeptical about some parts
But not all
Do you even know what that is
It's a HP theory about    the chess game in Book 1 being a metaphor
The part    I'm skeptical about is the part in which it says Ron    is Dumbledore
At least LOTR is over with and nobody comes up with    stupid theories anymore
But I still love the songs from the Hobbit
In any case, I've decided that sending long, weird    emails to people is fun
Ahh, Jeff is influencing me
Lisa, save me
He's    going to make me all Jeff-like and scary
I mean, come    on
I can't be like Jeff
That's just not right
I know, I'll make my emails better than his
You ought to write one this cool, Lisa
It'll bring    back memories of old times
Well, not so old, really
Jeffrey63090 (10:07:41 PM): i had a record of not    sleeping past 9am     I mean, come on
Is that sane
Is it
IS IT
I think not
Sleeping until 10:00 or 11:00 or 11:45 is    fun
Well, not quite fun
But it's restful
Obviously
Isn't it obvious
I think so
Unless you're an idiot    like Jeff, you will see that
Maybe he'll see it, too
Then again, you can never    know with him
Just like you can never know if he's being sarcastic    or not
Hmm
The problem with writing wrong emails is that you    cna't tell if it's long or not when you're writing it
I mean, come on
If you think about it, it takes so    much more time to WRITE the email than to READ it
Unless you're Jeff, who reads as fast as a Snail    walks
That's SLOW
Like ultra
Hmph
Anyway, I think I'll stop boring you--and me for that    matter
Plus my wrist is starting to bother me
Bye
this is going to be one wild chain lettery thing     lol    "send this letter or else we will hunt you down and force jeff's company    upon you"     thats rich     but seriously     im glad i did it    otherwise i would have been bored     9/18/04    this is something i've been talking a lot about, and sending to a couple    of people, but it tells a good story, when i send my reply
Sweet
SHE wrote this
JEFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF    awww i dont hate u i love u judst not in that way hehe IM REALLY HYPER SO    BEAR W/ ME HERE OK
OK OK
u goping to orentation
wheres ur locker    tty;     silence is a wonderous thing    both deadly and comforting    and all at the same time    so tell me:    why is it a crime to seek solace in silence
I wrote this:     yay    i have a friend
im so happy    by the way you didnt seem very hyper    and im not going    im so sad too    but i have some other very important things to do    im getting my braces off    its an all day dealio since i have to migrate to delaware for this    deal-io    yay    lol    just kidding    im not very hyper    but im typing and thinking very quickly    by my standards at least    seeing as everyone thinks im slow    i know im not    but to tell you the truth    i think im developing ADD    since i was reading jane eyre    wait i feel a story coming on    so put that add thing on hold (once again proving that i may be developing    it
well for one thing, all the action comes in spurts    like theres five PAGES of descripions on one persons FACE    OH MY GOD
but, thing is, that comes in handy when something interesting happens    then it doesnt stop happenning for like three days of reading    at least for me--- uhg so slow    and yet another tip    dont read it while listening to no doubt    especially if the track playing is "running" while going through certain    pages
i almost cried a few times because of that    so sad    oh and ESPECIALLY dont read while the song "dont speak" is playing    thats just asking for a tear jerker in some spots    i mean even without music, the last three chapters could draw tears    but with
i was fighting them off as "dont speak" was pounding into my    head
i could
feel Mr
Rochester's caress
powerful stuff
back to ADD, and me
i seriously have doubts of my mental well being now    i mean    since first grade, my teachers thought i was either "on something" or in    need of being "on something"    like time-out was NEVER a punishment because i was so irreppressable    i would sit in time out and just talk to my hands    or laugh out loud at my own little fantasy    or some strange thing would just over come me    and this one time, a long time ago
in third grade
anyway, a long time ago in a state far, far away    (star trek theme plays, while star WARS scroll come out of the side of the    screen)    the time is third grade (ish)    an evil teacher    DOES SOMETHING    SOMETHING TERRIBLE
well enough of that    the point is im getting to a story, albeit slowly    feel free to make fun of my spelling and grammar    we just finished reading some crap-ass book (thats some bad spelling didnt    mean to say that
right, so, we're supposed to answer some question on this thing, and i    know i completely missed the point, but try to bear with me and not hurt    my feelings    the question was this: "which has greater respect, a janitor, or a    president
look at    what a president has accomplished in his lifetime, as opposed to the    janitor
I am sure that there is another answer other than this but it is    beyond my comprehesion
thank fully, i acutaully learned a life lesson    sucking up is much more valuable than telling the truth     So, in 7th grade we were asked to do some strange crap for keyboarding    class that goes along the lines of what the most important life lesson    youve ever learned     i wrote a one page fantastic essay on how everyone is all equal and some    amazing awesome stuff that made me look either like a total suck up or a    very heroic person     it was good enough to get published in our school newspaper, the only one    that WASNT sent twice to my house, but was rather not sent at all
shame     anyway i probably have add, am not going to orientation, am at locker    a-083, am in hr 217 with Ms
Davila, and the only real crime with silence    is that the rest of the people are silent for you while thier insides hold    a maelstrom of fury
looking back on this mail, which has been sent to many many people    i wonder, how did i get on all those other subjects
ADD my @$$     ***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************    Ok I need a new section for this
4 real :P    its
Runner @ heart    dedicated to just a few of the good times that X-C and Track have given    me
There's a lot more, but its hard to remember them all
Crazy moments:    Warinanco -Sophmore Year- THOUSANDS of Acorns are littered abound
SO
we do the natural thing
shove them down people's shirts    We eventually make our
subjects
so incredibly fat the shirts were    getting ridiculously stretched out and such
Christian had to do the    "pregnant walk" and Kita was just hilarious as a fatty
Spring Track- Freshman Year- Dave Siuta, after a minute of practicing in a    corner, asked everyone "HEY is this how you do B-skips
Then he stomps his foot
or at least tries
He misses the ground: his leg swings wildly and he just hammers into the    ground
Everyone points and laughs
It was great
3/21/06    My dentist    Today instead of doing distance running
I slacked off and did jumps    But I did have a good excuse
dentist appointment at 5
so leave at    4:30    My dentist and I have a fun conversation
got any plans for this summer
ummmmmm running
camp
I could never do something like that
sprints or
long distance
I couldn't do that
The most I've ever gone is like 5    miles
In short "when you sign your first shoe contract
Think of the guy who    cleans your teeth
Hipple     Tuesday, 4/25/06 (track season)    It was against Steinert
we won our first meet of the season (1-3    record
Well, first of all, mass confusion as to where exactly we were
We got    there without taking any wrong turns or anything, but everyone was like
OK, we're in Hamilton
but there's like three schools in Hamilton
PG (Paul Genevisi) clarified which was which, but I didn't really follow
West, East, North
we PASSED the North
so its not that one
it was    kind of random
Also, we passed Red, White, and Blue
the swim team's goofy apparel    store
a thrift store with a bunch of random things
organized by    type
then color
We passed by Siperstien's Paint Store
shaped like a giant bucket of    paint
interesting
I forget
Things go pretty regularly
but the girls are first    (kind of random)
Well, then comes the mile
Now I'm in this
So its me, Matlack, Pat,    Nick, and Dave
As the gun goes off
Matlack completely PWNS everyone
He's all alone
Then
their top runner jumps up with him, and we get a    nice look at the back of his red hair (natural)
Then
we realize that    we're going REALLY SLOW, and everyone leaves me
So now we have a giant pack of four
their guy right behind, and then    me
and we still seem to be going real slow
Then, Dave PWNS everyone, and our team follows
Dave, I guess, wanted to    win pretty badly
so he takes up an actual race pace
We sort of thin out by the 3rd lap
and it's our top three, and us other    three in a pack
I decide that I don't want to be left behind, so I play a    little catch up
It feels like I simply slowed everyone else down,    because I don't feel tired, but I see myself catching up easily
On the    last lap, I think about catching up, but don't really feel like it
so I    do that little passively trying thing (its when you think about it so hard    that hopefully your legs will catch them for you &#61514; )
Well, last    200 comes up
and Pat starts to give it a nice jog in
and I make an    insane mad dash to get him
I was easily 50 yards back, and I start    revving it up
By the last straightaway, I feel like I'm fresh, and doing    a sprint
I'm really hauling ass, or Pat's just jogging it in (probably    the latter)
I'm burning up the track
zooming up
I'm practically right behind him,    and I see him pick it up a little
Then
someone screams "PATTTTTTT HES    RIGHT ON YOU
it was seriously as if he was the only sound in    the entire place, so
Pat sort of give his 10 yard sprint to hold me    off
and we TIE
I thought I might have gotten him
having him only give a little push at    the end, and me full speed with at lean to get the win
washsda;jflka (was it)" I ask the official
pointing to us    two
I was a little short on breath for the second, so I had an excuse
I'm like "ok thanks
So goes my defeat
but with immense    awesome
I broke 5 for the first time too
I also didn't feel the race at all, except that I was breathing hard    during it, and my butt hurt a little after it too (left side)
Other than    that it was the easiest race ever
So for the rest of
forever, I will always say "I was THIS CLOSE
And skip    school) was in two days, and they couldn't decide who was going to be the    fourth part of the 4x8
It was obviously Meg Fitz, Marissa, Claire    (wait
I thought it was    Sarah, no contest, but she's been injured
Maggie had a beastly first 500,    and Sarah looked like she was going to die
then the tables turned and    Sarah ended up zooming up with an opponent and getting second like 30    yards in front of Maggie
Crazy race
Richard went zoom zoom during his 800 (2:06 I think
quite quick)    Mike Stellino went BAM BAM BAM during his 200 (false start by miles
and    the other guy didn't stop until the third time the gun went off
they both ran the 3200
and Richard was burned
and Stelino was    a sprinter
So it was the goofiest thing ever
Stelino got a good time
um
12:15ish
Lol    The girls also ran the 3200
But they were goofing off
They used it as a    work out
and did one lap jog, half lap run
Claire and Marissa
with    Anna
It was goofy
Marissa was talking every now and then, Claire    (supposedly) shot faces to random people, and Anna though she was about to    die
Marissa got 2nd at 12:99:99 (one of their girls just slipped away on    the first lap
Our team was jogging &#61516;
or maybe &#61514;
It    was strange
4/27/06 Thursday    All of our coaches were at Penn Relays for the Girls, and I was about to    leave for 4 days on the Annapolis Band trip
so practice was really BS
They (who
I don't know) told us everyone to go for a 20 minute run
So I    was like YES
until they said "except for distance, you go for 40    minutes
Well, the day before I had a rough time
doing Kunkel-No    Trespassing
and ended up at an hour
going amazingly slow through the    Pennington School's track, with only the general idea of how to get back    to my school
Life's tough
So this day's practice, already BS, started off with a bit of confusion,    but we finally grouped up and left
We got to the stoplight, and there was    Jamie, Abby, and Anjina
So
I enjoyed a nice 25 minute walk to Abby's house, some ice cream, and    a ride back
We talked about all sorts of things, and Jamie and Anjina were stealthy    like, and stowed away in the pickup bed
leading some random person we    passed (they knew her, and waved) to be smiling and laughing as we passed
Strange day
9/1/06 Friday    Lets just start by understanding this: some of our girls are not the    brightest
I don't know exactly when this was
it could have been as much as a week    ago
but it is by FAR my favorite Megan Fitzpatrick quote
and yogurt
AND peanut butter
I might be remembering the wrong thing
but I just    hear the first part and start laughing
a runner of her level
eating    nothing but tiny Cheerios made me laugh
and
the peanut butter was with    this amazing enthusiasm
like
she couldn't remember eating anything
and then suddenly "I GOT IT
this next story is a lot more concrete
don't worry
We were warming up for hill repeats yesterday
well, lets just see as if    it were today
8/31/06 Thursday    Today was Hill repeats
as Thursdays usually are
but recently our    warm-ups have been to run the course
instead of just 20 minutes in the    woods
So, as our usual tradition is walking for five minutes
we were kinda    slow to get going
As we got under way, I found myself at the head of the    pack
so I slowed up and waited
and waited and waited
To get past the two soccer fields at the start
took about 2 minutes to    the usual one
Well, this seemed to be fine, and I didn't complain
I just settled back    with everyone else and somehow we made a human wall, trapping the girls    team behind us
along with our two rather unhappy coaches
I think helping his brother unpack)
Well, we headed into the long    stretch with all the reeds/long grass/whatever it is, and at this point
I realize I'm going to be hearing Kelsey's voice for the rest of the    run
but at this point, I don't really care
It's not like she's THAT    annoying, I figure
I had a REALLY hard time    distinguishing her regular whiny voice from the whine that usually comes    with this sort of sarcastic comment
I'm not sure whether she was    serious or not
BTW, this brings back memories of a two mile we did in track last year    (sophomore year)
The first 100 found me in the front
so I took the    inside and slowed down
as we rounded the first turn, we all broke into    chatter about how we SHOULD keep this nice casual talking pace
but we    wont
eventually someone passes me
and brings us to the same exact    pace
and finally as we finished the first lap, Matt and two members of    another team break off and the REAL race starts
I donno if that's    a real word, but she interjected it
but I'm just saying
in NO WAY help me figure    out if she was sarcastic or not
She could be serious, and kinda    indignant to Meg reading her wrong
or she wasn't, and indignant anyway    because she was just pointing it out
Hard girl to figure
Well anyways
we run around for a while, maintaining the human wall, to    the anger of our coaches
and we space out a bit more
letting some    girls come up with me
but not much changed
Except
I was REALLY tired of hearing Kelsey, I pushed my way forward    after the first big uphill to try to get her voice out of my ears
but    it really carries
Christian and Richard had a fun time with the branches that hung into the    road
Christian would run through them
and they would flip back and    smack Rich in the face
starting a humorous conversation
As we came up to the same reed/long grass/junk road
Meg says
It's going to be SO    cold
It's supposed to be sunny this weekend
very quietly
as if it being sunny would make the beach    ANY more bearable
NJ beaches are FREEZING
score is 2-0 for her
I call this a foul
We'd    better go today
Meg says "As if one day is going to make a difference
Basically
our girls are retarded
It took at lot of effort not to laugh
Friday 9/1/06    You know what makes me angry (I've had this thought for a while now, so    just bear with me)
How Milk is not a runners food
Sure
it's a liquid    (and can therefore not be anyone's FOOD), and Sure it makes you run really    terribly, and Sure it provokes the need to drop a
well, you know
But still
it should be a runner's food
Milk, btw, is good
I really like it
Now this seems like a random,    juvenile statement, but sometimes (however rarely) life is just that    simple
Girls, however, are not
but that's something ENTIRELY (well,    technically not
girls make milk) different
The point is
Milk has    everything you need in it
Nature designed it that way
Before humans were    around, Little Chimps all around the world were sucking down milk like    there was no tomorrow
Do you know why
Because it has EVERYTHING you    possibly could need when you're a little chimp trying to become the alpha    male
the Silverback, or what have you
Why did I bother to tell you that
Because
if Milk has everything you    need to grow up to be big and strong
why can't you drink it on race    day
It doesn't make any sense
According to one of the X-Treme guest speakers
but it COULD be because milk contains proteins and    fats
which should not be consumed before competitive events
You just    want masses of Carbs
Well, although I will give Nature a standing ovation for her work on    milk
Human (actually, a lot of animals have this problem) design was a    bit flawed
Seriously, if it's so good for me
why can't I
Well, besides the fact that during and after races, your blood is masses    in your muscles, and hopefully not in your stomach (it helps get oxygen    and your body's good sugars into muscles and lactic acid out
so you    want your stomach empty, otherwise your blood will get confused going two    places at once and you will feel awful) I personally see no reason why    humans should have been built without the capability to handle Nature's    miracle drink before racing
In fact, Runners (and all athletes) are recommended to drink either water    or Gatorade about 30-60 minutes before their race/game/whatever
WHY NOT MILK
Say you're a baby cow
happily drinking milk (it's good stuff)
Well,    you know for a fact that because of milk, you will become a healthy,    strong cow
who's bones and muscles will benefit from the nutrients    and
other good stuff that's in milk (for a complete list
see someone    smarter than me
it could be difficult to find one :P )
Well, it's too    bad that this won't happen, because 20 minutes later a hungry wolf sees    your little herd of cows and organizes his pack
By now you've had a nearly a
hour of digesting that milk, and you see    the pack of wolves
The herd starts to run away, but ALAS, you drank milk and are now    suffering from a severe cramp
WHY
Because fats and proteins take FOREVER to digest
and now you have    a bunch of them in your stomach
Your blood is in your digestive organs    instead of in your legs
when you start to run, you don't have enough in    your muscles OR stomach to use either effectively
You suffer from cramps,    immense pain
and slowness
Those Wolves have never found an easier    meal
LIFE ISN'T FAIR
WHY CAN'T YOU DRINK MILK BEFORE A RACE
THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY
If you skipped down here, thats not very nice, start from where you left    off and read it all
stop it, you're hurting my feelings
to fun places     Life, or something like it-my other site    the gord who has adventures at his shop    a freaky coincidence with my brother
8/11/09     (was watching Gilmore girls season 2, episode 11-Richard in Stars Hollow)     When you watch a show about something that you've never experienced, but    the actors/actresses have, and they're PHENOMENAL actors/actresses (or are    playing themselves, basically), you tend to FEEL the emotions and see the    details as if it were real life, or as if you were them
BUT, what about this:     I watched bits and pieces of Gilmore Girls when I was younger
Too young    for girlfriends, or love, or business, or pain, or feeling old, or feeling    useless (well, beyond the uselessness of a young child)
And I felt it through them
And I understood the pain and the emotions,    and the thoughts, and everything
But now that I'm watching it again, I say to myself "No
I didn't    understand
NOW I do
Better put: Every time I watch this, I will feel as    though I understand
But now, I SAY that I didn't/couldn't before
The    truth of my past cannot be determined
This causes two things
This leads to: what about things that are "beyond my actual personal    experiences" that I feel I understand now, GREATER than I did before
Will    those also be thought of in this way when I am older, and watch the show    again
Will I think to myself "there's no way I could have understood how    it felt to be old and useless at 19
Love parts
Will those only be    absolutely understood if I become a woman, get married, have many    relationships, etc
Also, as someone without a    sister/daughter/girlyfriends do I not understand any of them
At the least, I feel as though I understand more of it now, than I did    before
But I remember feeling like I'm not missing anything
In essence:      1
The past understanding is flawed, as currently believed
Therefore,        the possibility of being currently wrong, but feeling certain exists
Or, possibly, I understood fine back then
Fine
but not necessarily    great
I may have missed some things
Which is fine
And the effect of this show is to feel emotionally enlightened
But if one    effect of the show is to feel enlightened, then does that mean that I    could have possibly not learned/felt anything
Feeling sympathetic    emotions is practice for life and therefore learning (or at least, we will    define it as that, as it seems to be a commonly held, and very useful,    belief)
This is all fine, because they always say that you learn more the second    time you read/watch something
At the very least, it's more practice    feeling the same emotions
More often, you just catch things that you kind    of missed the first time
A mini- like a skirt     This is a good one
it was an everyday event that I'm hoping everyone    will be able to smile and agree with me on
After all, that's why I    started writing, to share little stories like this, and keep them in my    memory forever
And black is a very pretty color, and she    looks good in it
As I'm thinking this, I scold myself
but at the same    time have some crazy memory stuff going on
It is because of those memories that I pose the question: "Do girls have,    like, an on/off sexy switch
sort of like she's    laughing at me, but is still in awe of my stupendous powers of stupidity
She also incorporates fear of my insanity
Seeing this look, and fearful of loosing audience, I immediately explain    myself
but you didn't really notice
now you know)     "so I'm sitting at my lunch table, and
and, um
someone's sitting here
Unfortunately, I usually tend to go at a madman pace, and    nearly scream out
Also, beware of the hands
they like to move about    during stories
ANYWAY, back to the story     "so we're calmly sitting there, and nothings happening
I mean
like    just sitting there
Well, we're talking, but nothing interesting's    happening
Like
just sitting there, you know
I was like    WHOA, and
Kevin M
G
has    joined the fun
this usually happens because of money
Why it was there we will never know
So I give this to her
and
um
I fetch it from his pocket
ewww"     In all this, I never really got an answer from Kristin
I think she has    one, and that's why she wasn't stripping for the twenty
then we could    SEE the switch
and when that happens, there's just no hope for woman's    rights ever again
So, soon thereafter, I find Marissa, and relate this whole story, adding    and leaving out details as my subconscious sees fit
About halfway through    I catch her with a worried/scared look
It was interesting, but I decided    some things are better left to the quiet, dark parts of our minds
It might also be of use to know that when I talked with her over the phone    that night, I reminded her that she never answered the question {DO they    have switches
She had no idea what I was talking about
So I told her the story again, adding a few minor details, but generally    shortening it
This all done, of course, when I was sure nobody was within    hearing range
I think she was put off about the fact that I was being VERY superficial
But honestly, she was pretty incredible
Oh
did I forget to mention the fact that she was the one stripping     I guess I have to tell the WHOLE truth now
with just a bit of creative editing)     unless
of course, if you don't really want to hear the WHOLE thing over    again     (that one phrase usually makes everybody run for cover rather than hear    another long, rambling story
you're lucky I only got into one tangent    and left out my gothic analogy
you wont get away so easily this time)     well, as I said, it was Friday, and nothing in particular was happening
It was perfectly normal, I ditched my table and went over to Marissa's
I    was trying to touch her and give her hugs
to the discontent of her and    Fedor
Only thing different about today is that I had my own chair, and I    was VERY un-self conscience
We were discussing how cold we were at the moment
Naturally, I have little to no idea of what she's talking about
I give    her a funny look
an UNDER- ARMOR" I solemnly shake my head
Underneath is a shirt
I never knew being able to see the button at the    top jeans could be so attractive, but simply THAT much exposure of her    body made me go crazy
In awe I watched as she reached up under her shirt    and pulled out a final layer
It was under-armor
sort of a flexible,    stretchy fabric, which I can assume keeps the wearer very warm
At this point, I'm not really a rational thinker, so when she lets the    layers of clothes just flop over covering her skin; I immediately sigh and    think "BLASPHEMY"     Feeling kind of depressed, and a LOT horny (I was probably drooling by    then) I reach out and try to find the skin again
When I get pushed away, I just sort of sit back and mope
Sigh
Yes, it was a sad day
But now I will always remember something very    important     Marissa has hips, and they are GOOD
She's also very skinny, but that's just from x-country     I wonder if she has a on/off sexy switch
I need to write something
or at least it feels that way     I think its weird, but what ISNT if you think about it too much     For example
most people I know would say that its normal to be slightly    more comfortable typing instead of normal writing     But think about it, isn't that a little backwards
If you're writing you    have total control, more freedom and you can do little doodles and random    drawings
If you're typing, none of that happens
You trade freedom for    structure and ease
Pencils make your hands tired, and you have to HOLD    the pencil
Here you just rest your hands on the keyboard
It sort of acts like kind of `metaphor' if you will, for growing up
Or at    least what I've seen
As a kid, you can just do whatever you want
You're not really GREAT at    anything yet, unless you have some just innate talents
Then slowly, you specialize
Some people switch into advanced math and    science classes, and others simply take tons of drawing things, and love    it
You just suddenly stop asking the same kind of questions
even stop    thinking about things in general
I miss just being able to sit in my room and stare at a random wall doing    nothing at all but thinking of the weirdest things and trying to figure    them out
Now (or is it just me) we can go whole days, weeks even doing    nothing but nonstop work, and then spend our free time going out with    friends to just vent
And I suddenly wondered
sometimes you go and write something like this-    to drop your ideas off     I remember thinking this once
you have to be perfectly balanced     Social, mental, physical-or just "structure" and "chaos"     Lets take that last one
This whole thing is "structure" its pointing    ideas into a focused area, theres structure in the very telling of ideas,    even if the structure is loose by any other standpoint
Pure chaos is like, just the ideas- theres so many of them, they just    freely bounce and float around
Its good to do that once in a while
When you're writing mostly everything is "the same color light" focusing    and brightening and making everything more distinct
If you're just    thinking and letting yourself go loose, your lights are whatever colors    they feel like being, and can change at a moment's notice
Sometimes you just need time to sit there and process things, but life    isn't usually nice like that
Everything happens at the same time, and you    have to react, or be left behind
Its like dreaming
sometimes you don't    ever feel it
But you're totally fine with it     How is it that I seem to have the quality of attracting these fantastic    people that are so great at things
Abby Stern, who's advice is epic
Nick Gabinet, who once talked of his girlfriend, saying that although he    very much enjoyed her company, and wished it could go on forever, he    doesn't "put too much stock" in high school relationships, because he    knows that they will quickly end
It was and incredibly sad thing to say,    a terrible thing to hear, and shockingly wise
Converstaion with Abby: 1/26/09, after the "breakup" with Sarah, a week    into the new semester, and coming back from Elaine Chao's
Looking forward to awkward things ending at high    school
But really, I think they just get worse
Her: Oh, I suppose
Not always
Me: Well, the whole pushy friend situation (And graduation) both seem to    be even more severe
Her: Oh
That's not awkward
He and I have talked about it a lot
We're Going to stay together
we're not worried
well, he's not
Me: Hmmm
But
REAL LIFE starts
i don't think i could handle real life
Her: Going from high school to college is so different than going from    college to grad school, or the real world
People stay together, often
Me: oh
Her
Well, we love each other, so we're hoping it will work
I know that's    not always enough, but we're going to try
I told him that going in
Me: I think the problem, is that I am absolutely terrified of putting    distance into things
that when people are far away,    I feel almost as though they will vanish
Or that they already have    vanished
In my mind, they sometimes are already gone
But Jeff, Things are Scary, but that    Doesn't mean They Aren't Worth It
Me: But, You're totally fine
Nobody else seems to be afraid
Afraid of relationships
Afraid of things not working
I Still am afriad to    get hurt in the end
But even if that happens, it's been totally worth it
already     Me:
Her: You should take a chance, even if you're scared
as corny as that    sounds
Me: Ah
No, it's probably the perfect thing     To say to someone like me

Boring things for boring people
You can't change the past
Not even if you try as hard as you can
If you could, you'd be the first
Then I'll try
One way or another, your mind will snap
It's not as strong as the    universe is
Either you'll eventually give up, or you'll see the past    differently
The only options are to find another way, or to create a    different reality, one that only exists in your mind
And if MY mind is stronger than the universe
Then what
You'll have changed the past, and destroyed everything
Could    you be happy, even if you can break time
Everything will be broken
He's so weird
I walked quietly, with quiet thoughts about quiet things
The sky was dark    and the street was damp, and I could feel their judgment
This morning, while meditating, I felt something
Was it fear
I've been meditating for ten years
Does it surprise you
When I behave differently, it's because I see things differently
Imagine if you saw the world like this all the time
With colors faded by    darkness, even on the brightest days
Or if you were colorblind
Imagine a world where every sound was silence
Or if all sight was    nothing
This would certainly change the way the world is
Recently, I've been thinking about being a quaker,     But you can only be what you are
And religion is the practice of changing your mind to some common    standard
I should make friends with people with quiet minds
Boring people like boring things
So to be more effiecient for studying, shouldn't you simply quiet your    mind
Think deep thoughts     Stare at a cloudy sky until you can see the stars
Listen to the sound of nothing
Think about everything until you feel as though you could rip the world    apart
These things come and go
In a few days or months, I'll be completely    different, but said to be the same person
It's strange that in our    society, we consider bodies to be the unit of humans rather than the    minds
Once the singularity comes, that will all change
And how many times have I heard YOU talking
Do you honestly believe that    you're the correct one in this situation
There is no right and wrong in    this

Haha, Rosie, I'm totally lusting over your hot, sweet body
You seriously need to cheer up
I doubt you could have said something serious with the word "lusting" in    it without me laughing
Is it just me or is that word one of the funniest    words in the English language
So, sorry for lusting
And you refuse to believe that I want anything to do with you besides your    body
You used to refuse to believe I ever wanted anything to do with you at    all
And now you're an emo child
If you opened your eyes you would probably    see things a little better
Was I ever blind to you
Marissa seemed to think so
She was always afraid    when you walked by, because she knew I would turn to look
She knew that anything she said in the few brief seconds I saw you a day,    anything she said was muted, and even your footsteps were like a symphony    to me
The sway of your hair when you walked was a concert of angels
playing    guitars
Ok, sorry for the ridiculous analogy, but whatever

she didn't say she liked taking pills     maybe she simply doesn't
I know I don't really enjoy taking pills
Later, she said never to mention them again
Promised
Ok
Pretty soon, we were talking about countries, and nations, and her    hippiness, her wonderlust, and freedom
We're very different
She wants to leave, because she feels like she's going nowhere if she does    the same thing every day
I like to stay, and get better through experience (hopefully)
She wishes that there were no nations, just free people- free from    description, discrimination, bias, and excuses to be hurtful
I like simplification (N

Hey Abby
How's it going
Hope I didn't wake you up
Well, it is like 10:00ish
so you should be up
Abby, (this is about to get kind of awkward) I have something to say
and I think it would be a lot better if it were in poem form     I'm not good at writing poems
but that's ok
It's special for you
so I'll pull out all the stops
Look
A poem
A long time ago's     (or so the story goes),     there was a fair maiden     that nobody was a' hatin'
hmmmmm rhymes pretty good)     And she was about THIS tall, (motion with hands)     I think I met her in the Fall,     her name was Abby
Having her as a friend is a treat,     She makes me happy     And she is very sweet
I'm many things     but I don't have wings
I'm a runner     and a writer,     I think I bake pretty good,     but I'm a dumb boy
Understood
So when I'm mean and not nice     tell me, and don't hold back
My head deserves to be stuck in ice,     Cuz you're bringing sexy back (yeah
to make it right, I do long
So in a way of apology,     (Dave Siuta wants to study meteorology)     I made you a special batch     of sweets, mismatched
In short I'm very, very sorry
And you have the wrong idea
Every time I see you, I get all starry     I think you're beautiful
like Korea
Yellow sticky:     He spoke softly, with a light, feminine touch, as if to make up for all    the rest of the world's hum, to counteract the thousands of screaming,    angry voices, or to distinguish himself from the loud Other people
Maybe,    it was just to put a wry smile on every word he said, turning up the    corners of each sentence in a gently sad, sarcastic way

Eyes only look at what interests people
Like I was saying with Katherine,    when I'm trying to figure out what's going on, I'll look at what everyone    else is looking at
Maybe because that's what interests me most: other    people's emotions and thoughts
But when I was eating breakfast/lunch with Kathleen, Suli, and Steph,    Kathleen and Suli looked at each other, and around the room, Steph looked    at her phone and around the room, and I looked at my food, the others, and    around the room
So
are Suli and Kathleen together
or once were
Bernard Morin can flip a sphere, and is also blind
That's mad crazy
I    wanna see that
When I look at the world, I think of the image I see as a two-dimensional    screen representation of a 3-D world
Is that wrong
How other people see    it
Also, when I'm imagining things on a large scale, I use a top-down 2-D    map
Important to note, is that 3-D is just a 2-D map with infinite    Perpendicular sections that create a space
So
if I was looking for a    way to experience the world without eyes, I would probably map the world    in 2D, but only worry about 3D when I approach objects I need to interact    with
I feel like thinking in constant 3D would tire me out too much

Jeffrey's story, CONTINUED     As it were, I was STILL mulling over you're heartfelt confession
YES    STILL     Pretty pathetic
yeah, whatever     Anyway, BECCA, felt the need to gossip about HOW much you liked me, and so    on and so forth
This particularly fell into my mind, and was just going    over and over in my head
SO, what I could do is the only thing left- or at least, the only thing I    WANTED to do
Write a WHOLE mess of letters BACK
And
then promise myself that I would give them to you the next day    right at homeroom, or right as you came OUT of homeroom, or whenever
But
me being me, I couldn't do it
So all of Wednesday, I was
being    weird
Nothing out of the ordinary, but it was mostly because I was distracted    with all the weirdness going on and what was going to happen and such
All I could really think about, was how NOTHING was going to happen
ever     I mean, I've never gone out with anyone
kissed
and am basically a    loser     That, and I have like 0 TIME
I have no time to do anything, least of    all, what I would WANT to do- thanks to my parents
That was already written in one of the letters, whatever
Note
letter
is there a difference
They're fun-ish to write, but make me have a headache     So much teen drama- it's weird     So, now I have all these letters just sitting in my binders, in    inconspicuous places, and totally guilt-laden, but still, I do nothing
At    this point you should feel very sorry for me- or just laugh in my face
Actually, I feel pretty tired right now, I should take a nap     Or, seeing as its 10:15, FINALLY take a shower, and go to bed
But wait, now im stuck writing this letter
Yay for me- and my non-creativity     Anyway, so I make all these letters- and promise the next time I wear my    very colorful sweatshirt, I'll give her all those letters
Next thing I know, this SINK is spraying me full of water
Im all wet and    its basically just a mess
today I wore my colorful hoodie- thing, and
Lo and behold-    wimped out
again
BUT, I did get to play with your hair
the whole    while feeling the slightest bit weird- since my brother was right    there
Creepy
Also
all those letters were just at arms length away in my backpack
Goody goody- I dodged another bullet     This story is crap- I should re-write it sometime
Facebook note     Something that Came to Mind     1/13/08 at 12:48 in the morning     Though these fragments are linear, they didn't necessarily happen exactly    as reported
Specifically, some of them never happened outside my mind
Actually, nobody should even bother reading this
How about you
Well, the person I like
turned me down
But now we're BEST FRIENDS     You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you
She    thought i was a total loser
Not much has changed since then
Steph Yang responds at 10:14     i don't understand this girl
why won't she just go out with you
i mean, you guys spend enough time together
sort of
Abby privately responds at 8:44     jeff, what are you talking about in your note
Sasha Murr was talking to me    outside the school, and we faced a wall in the cold, often not saying    much
The cold felt good for me, but she seemed too cold
We talked about    boys
and girls
Next I told her    that I was clearly not in a relationship with Sarah Cuprizinski
And next    was that she might be gay, and I asked Sasha if she knew anything about    that
The last line is what I thought about the history of my relationship    with Sarah
Ook, so this all happened because I felt guilty
More specifically, I felt guilty about ignoring you, and about thinking of    you
Its weird, because I always try my best to contain myself and try to    listen, but I never quite catch the words, and my mind tends to simply    wonder off
Its like whenever I just randomly leave to go to my next    class, leaving you behind with no dignity
Which, by the way, I feel    guilty for also, usually after about two or three steps
Im so tired, I can barely think most of the time
Which is funny, because    im writing this at 11 at night when I should be sleeping or doing    something constructive
But no
I somehow rationalized you to the top of the list again
This    happens often
Example: Saturday, I'm mentally planning out my day
I    think, I should call Marissa after the meet to tell her that im going to a    party, and its not my fault if I majorly flirt with a couple other people
they're the ones I can get away with and they wont take it that im    ACTUALLY hitting on them
but then    realize
That never happens
but    still basically being a chicken-wuss
So the world spins about on its axis    one more time, and its Sunday
Im mentally planning out my day: this never    works on Sundays, but I do it anyway
Im thinking math
LA
Then SS,    then call
Then I think
oh wait, SS will take about 5 hours
And
I don't have 5 hours after all that crap
considering I was    hiding in my room until about 10
anything to avoid work
So
once again
calling Marissa becomes prioritized all the way up to    1- you know so I wont get distracted while TRYING to work and just think    of you all day
This happens more often than I would like
I think my entire lunch    table knows this by now
Basically, I was thinking of you
Then    said
Then I realize what I was saying
distracted" of course,    EJ picks up easily
So then, I shoot off into a side story about how I    think
Its very common for me to explain this, because everyone always    gives me that funny look
Its been explained as "you're a freak Jeff" and    as "do you have ADD
as always, "I don't get it")     yesh
Anyway, so now, once again I've sent my guilt out onto some piece of    paper
Much better typed than in my illegible scrawl, so im finding out     Im also afraid that someone's going to find all my papers     Not hard
considering they're ALL in a folder called "bored like me"     It's a book title
it has a rather nice story behind it     It ties in with LGB, something that others would call
a DIARY
Well
its ok either way
Just my way of taking notes on life     Maybe later aliens will find it and realize that they made a good choice    in destroying the human race
Im wondering how much freakier I can get without you leaving me     I'll try to control myself     Consider yourself lucky to have this: its been sitting in my folder since    Tuesday 12/14/04
so you can get rid of all the random bits that sort of    hang out uselessly
Hello
Sorry I haven't been able to get back to you in the past few days
Or, more accurately, the last few weeks
Whenever I think of talking with you, I'm always reminded of two things
1) Generally most conversations start with "So, how are things
This has always been a challenge to me, and I    generally take my time to reflect on all of the interesting and relatable    events that have been happening since the last time I've talked to that    person
This creates an even more formidable challenge when that person    has been generally removed from my life, and I'm left with the sense that    nothing interesting ever really happens in my own life
So, what's been up
Well, the only things that are really new in my life    (this is my first glance analysis), are that I have a quick talking    Australian voice going on in my head, and there's a Japanese female singer    also in there, competing for my attention
When I think longer on it, I've    been taken down to Florida, had my first track meet, and there was a    strange epic clash between good and evil (in the modern day, high school    drama type way
It's also a political
thingie
I've always heard of    that genre called a game/story/novel full of political intrigue, but never    as its own thing
The one thing I    hate most about prom is that the people that are most curious about my    "love life" (the quotation marks are generally quite appropriate for me)    are the people that I would be most interested in having a love life with
And YES, this comment had once applied to you, though it's somewhat less    clear whether it still applies now, or will in the future
With any luck,    that will be the most awkward thing I'll say in this letter, and this    sentence will probably have the most intentional ambiguity
2) I generally have a tendency to only really talk about my own life
The    reason behind this is obvious
I'm living my own life, not anyone else's
The thing about this, is that I always feel like I'm being extremely    selfish
Someone should establish a clear, obvious, and standard line that    marks the distinction between being selfish, and
whatever's on the    other side of the line
What would you call that
Being interested in the matters of the self, but    not in an egotistical way
Then, if you have a big ego, could you say more    than two words without being called selfish
Probably not, maybe that's    why the whole human system of first impressions simultaneously works and    completely fails
If we treated every conversation as our first, what    would be the social implications
And how could you fairly integrate    former knowledge about that person, when clearly there are circumstances    when it could go both ways (be helpful or detrimental to know who you're    talking to)
I guess the answer is that there's no formal standard that    could be applied to everyone (I've also noticed that I'm far too quick to    declare that there's no answer to the questions I ask
Often without even    trying to find the answer I declare it "one of those unanswerable    questions" or "I'd have to know specifics about the circumstances
I previously    wrote it off as "you'd have to do a lot more testing", and hadn't even    specified my variables or general theory
BAD SCIENCE
As in, selfish people usually say drivel about themselves, but    should probably talk about their deepest sorts of thoughts
The two    wouldn't be mutually exclusive if the selfish person were also shallow,    which is commonly the case
Even though it's inappropriate, after these    roundabout ways of saying "oh, right, nevermind, that DOES make sense" I    mentally add "QED"
I hope I'm not shallow
Anyway, what I was getting to before that last paragraph was that I didn't    make it into Princeton or Brown
This should probably be more upwardsy in    the "what's new section," but it isn't, because honestly, after about a    day or two, I completely forgot all about it
That's pretty much why I run    and have friends (and, I'm sure, why people in general have friends, and    contributes to one of the reasons a lot of people DO enjoy exercise)
After saying flat out "Man, I can't believe I tried 3 times as hard as my    brothers, I still only got into the same school
3) Most of my conversations with you have been about something that I need    advice on
That's not to say I don't need advice on anything right now
As said before, it's Prom season
That, and I think I'm at high risk for    being a life-ruiner
The girlfriends of people I know closely seem to    become much more huggable for their "unavailable" status
And that causes    problems
Morally, and in other ways too
Once upon a time, I had a good story to share about this
It was never    told, or written down, but the basic idea was that it was a conceit
Ever    since Mr
Seltzer told us that those had a name, I've wanted to do one
And I had the perfect idea
One day, My brain got all sorts of aspects of my life and mind mixed up    and told me "you can fly
all you have to do is jump
In a sort of, "the    apocalypse is a pretty cool event too" sort of way
But, that sort of    thing has always been pretty cool to me
The only thing that comment had to do with    anything else I was discussing is that Singularity, Dystopian futures, the    Apocalypse, and cool mental stuff are all closely related in my mind
Because being    completely messed up in the head never goes out of style
In Japan, at    least (this is a cultural reference that I didn't really grasp until about    a month ago, and suddenly I see it a ridiculous amount)
Time writing-wise
This is
a really bad    habit
I don't really like that about myself, but there's really not a lot    I can do about it (I think
I should test this out
Most of my    conversations are either about things I don't really care about, things I    REALLY care about, or things that the other person cares about- but is sad    about, and generally the only form of humor I know is to try to belittle    myself or the issue
How do you fix things that are broken
My most    frequent conversation with his girlfriend, who I see about 3-4 times a day    is almost exactly this:     "So
did you fix Matt yet
I told you, I don't know how
Well, I didn't know it was that simple
After that you have to insert dirty comment here
I've never known how to fix people, besides sit and listen, and honestly    wish I could do more
Which is weird, because there's pretty much nothing    I hate more than when a friend is going through a rough time
Which is    completely messed up, because I mean that in a completely selfish way,    even though it's the same thing the nicest sort of person would say
And, as I've always believed, hugs generally make the world better
The    last time something bad happened to me, it only took two hugs to go from    sad to perfectly fine
I'm still deciding whether that's a healthy sort of    transformation, or one that probably spells mental, social, and emotional    disaster in the possible future
The thing about statements of that sort, of course, is that it operates    under the assumption that a life changing, negative rupture of my life    will happen
Technically, if the status quo of all life is upheld (people    will eventually die), then the odds of this are ridiculously good (bad)
But it's easy to imagine a world where it isn't
And, as _____ always    says, "If you can imagine it, it could be
In Lit, we read a poem that said that "childhood is the kingdom where    nobody dies"
I liked it rather a lot
Partially, because the ending    reminds me of what I think my future will be
But mostly because it makes    me think about the whole thing kind of sideways
I've always had clashing    thoughts on whether I'm just like everyone else, or in some way    meaningfully different, and this poem is pretty much about exactly that    sort of thing
I'm slowly beginning to dislike AP Lit for an entirely    different set of reasons than I formerly had about it
At first it was    about Mr
Seltzer's style of holding class
It thought of it as sort of    hypocritical call-and-response system, where everyone's comments were    generally directed toward him, and he would respond as a teacher, though    we were always encouraged to see him as an "equal" in the discussions
Now, I'm seeing a trend toward alternately calling him a flaccid, weak    leader, and utterly ridiculous attention-hog
No objective perspective to compare to my highly    subjective viewpoint)
During a discussion on the Hollow Men, he sat back    and said nothing as we launched into a long debate on the symmetry when    comparing heaven to hell and the implications on the real world (actual    conversation was probably nothing like this
but that's what it felt    like to me)
I felt like lashing out at everyone and just saying "No, you    guys are all wrong, its insert my way of thinking here, and my way is the    ONLY right way
But clearly, this is not the way I    should treat people, especially when in a AP Lit classroom
So, despite    all my criticism, I generally don't say a word
Hypocrisy anyone
And in the end, I don't think I hit nearly everything I was planning on
I    also completely avoided pretty much any revisions after about a minute    from the original writing of it
Because if I stop now, it'll never get done
Which, ironically is the opposite of homework
If I ever get around to starting, it'll get done
Today, I didn't start
It felt pretty good
Spanish is really hard
Sorry for all the meaningless wandering around
Thanks for being there for me to send all this to
So, what's new in your life
8/12/09     (because I couldn't very well tell her (again
We are no longer sure on    whether I told her before
I was going to be just helping Marty out by driving him, and    was going to bring Elise along so I don't get bored
Using is a physical relationship without emotional attachment
Toy with is to try to get her to want me     Brainwash is to play with her mind     10:03pmElise     during swim season 2 years ago

10:05pmJeffrey     and takes advantage of openings (of which i have many)     10:05pmElise     i see     10:05pmJeffrey     also, she didn't seem very interested, ever     10:06pmElise     she flirts ALOT
i think too much sometimes     haha     10:06pmJeffrey     and she had a boyfriend when i started coming back to school

10:06pmElise     yea sorta but she didnt like him     10:06pmJeffrey     one of those times she did

one last thing (before i have to go)     10:09pmElise     hah ok
10:09pmJeffrey     how true do you think this is     1) snails are cute     and 2) slugs are gross and ugly     10:10pmElise     umm 1) i guess they could be 2) yes i agree     10:10pmJeffrey     feel free to use google to get pictures     i'm TOTALLY RIGHT
10:11pmElise     hahah     hahaha you thought the same

10:15pmElise     haha yay
10:15pmJeffrey     bye
10:15pmElise     oh     ok     ttyl
byee
I flinched- as if struck by a physical blow, and brought my hands    frantically to my head hoping to defend myself
but suddenly realizing    that it was all in my mind    my spine still tingled from the "attack" my hands burning
Whether it was her nearness or the disturbing fright of the movie- I    couldn't tell, I didn't want to know
All I knew is that I wanted it to stop, but the images were imprinted into    my mind
I knew they would stay there for a while now
This was my experience at the movies, and, maybe why it all didn't quite    fit into my mind yet, why it didn't ever make sense
I couldn't do it- later, maybe I'll know why, but for now, just know that    I wanted to
Creaaaaaaaaaak
Nervously, he looks up
Ghosts are real- he'd determined that a long time ago, but    needlessly stalking him
No, that was truly in his mind alone
Unfortunately, that's where it could do the most damage
He recalled briefly what brought him to this weak, whimpering state
Like    a common toddler after seeing frightful images of blood on the TV screen
that meant that it    was FOR SURE truly all in his mind
even better- soon he would be able to    recover
The whole night he had been reading- waiting for sunrise
And with that    sunrise, he would be able to leave that god-forsaken room and go    somewhere
He could go for a run, and SHE'd be there
He fancied an image of being held tight in her arms- but banished it    immediately
Those images had a habit of sneaking in when he was absently    sitting about- and didn't like to leave him alone
Alone- that's what he was
alone in the dark with his fears- so he'd lit    every light in his room hoping it'd banish the darkness of his mind
It didn't- he only sadly looked about and mocked himself for his weakness
Reduced to a sniveling child by a single movie
True, it seemed to prey on    every thought he'd ever had about the whole subject, and seemed to make    his fears come to life on the screen, but that's all it was
A MOVIE not    to be taken literally, not something that could attack him in his sleep
Or at least literally attack him
He recalled what little sleep he had
Purposefully waiting for one of his brothers to use the bathroom, he    quickly doused the light and quickly fell asleep knowing that he would    either die in view of his brother, or would slip into blissful sleep-    carrying him to the next day
There was no such luck
It was as if whatever ghosts there were in that room enjoyed taunting him
Easing his fears- he fell into sleep
And he dreamt
He dreamt of what had    happened, what would happen, what might happen
Hours were spent, surveying the river of time, and his surroundings in his    sleep
Then, he woke- with no fears, nothing, but expecting the day
One hour had passed since he'd slipped into the bliss of peace and there    were six more until daylight
Easing his racing mind, he once again fell asleep- and came to the same    rude awakenings
He'd dreamt a lifetime, in only 4 nappings- and only two hours had passed
Time crawled as he slept, and refused to move any faster as he woke
It was as if he were trapped there forever
For him, time stood still, as it would for no others
Fear makes things all possible and the everyday things nearly heroic to    complete
He held an all night vigil keeping awake until 7
The sunlight had lost its eerie blue glow, and he allowed himself    breakfast alone awaiting the run that morning
On the hour long bus ride, he could rest in peace
The sun would keep him    warm, friends keep him safe, and if all else failed, he would at least    have a relaxing jog through the woods of Holmdel park
Besides, she was there, Marissa
He reflected on what had EXACTLY happened
The ride to the theater was an interesting experience
Every family member reflected either himself in better days, or Marissa
It was an interesting experience, as we collectively harassed her to a    deep red shade of embarrassment, and proceeded to see if she would    literally break down with the continual poking fun of her newfound color
As I said
INteresting
When entering the theater, I didn't pay
Are you kidding
I should have, but I was lazy, confused, and generally being a slacker
It felt like part of me wanted to continually test her, see how far she    would go for someone she know so little about
I felt guilty about it    though, I felt, as I later said to my brother Kevin, "I acted like you"    His previous relationship ended due to an immense one-sidedness
followed by a no sidedness
Raechel was the continual pushing force behind him- dragging him to every    event, hinting and subtly urging on every kiss
Suddenly, during a less exciting part of the movie, Marissa's hand    in-discretely left its cross- armed state (mimicking my own fear-driven    one) and snaked under the armrest
Attracted by the movement, I looked about for it, and quickly found it
Soon I realized my hands were burning- sweating in their heat
Feigning to straighten my legs, I wiped them while pulling my
slightly    too short pants to cover my chilled ankles
She had lowered her hands there once before, but only for a second
At certain points in the movie, I was reminded of her nearness, and also    how skinny her legs were
Her knees were revealed closely by the    straight-legged jeans she wore
I remembered a time at Holmdel park, after her meet, she came to me
Asking for a hug, I put an arm around her waist holding her, even as she    told me how much his father would not appreciate the act
He seemed    oblivious
Grinning, I kept one eye on him, as I continued to hold her
At that    moment, it seemed for me to be incapable of sadness, unless she caused it
It seemed for a second, that it was just that easy
To just hold her,    forever, and forget the world
What she was wearing
That'd be useful to know
At first I was surprised    that she was so lightly dressed
She stood at the bottom of the entrance stairs, straight-cut jeans, red
spaghetti strap
Whatever
And a zip-up jacket- very light and thin- it hung loosely around her    shoulders, revealing them
I think it was the same red shirt she had on at Holmdel, where I held her    regardless of her wishes, and her dad
I slept only a few minutes at a time on that bus, but the motion made my    head ache at times
Despite this, I had an overwhelming sense of safety there, surrounded by    friends
And if not friends, then people who would at least care, who    COULD protect me at the very least
As I sat there, I heard bits and pieces of the girl's conversation
Not    really paying attention, at some times I thought they were yammering on    about me, something I quickly suppressed- control Jeffrey, you're not that    popular     My thoughts tended to disturb me, mostly about her, as they had been for    some time    this only made me uneasy, because I knew that sometime soon, they would    suddenly vanish, and the more I indulged the feeling now, the harder it    would be later, when that dreaded time came     I always worry for her, because everyone says she likes me so much, it    worries me that I do too
That's never happened before, to have someone who would WANT to be with    me, the random appearance of wanting for someone was not a new experience
I tried to discuss this with Marissa as we entered the theater
Only, I,    of course, used my usual discrete method of doing it
I poked fun of her many relations- which I discovered might not be that    many    Sean's brother first- I forget his name
then most recently Sean
now
ME
Something was peaceful about that fact; it eased my mind at the very    least
I just constantly fear that if I do go out with her, I will just one day    not want to anymore, so despite how much I want to now, I won't    I also fear for my lack of self control- and how I passively dodge the    truth without realizing it
I constantly think of her, it's the only thing on my mind lately
I feel    so inadequate
I imagine being held, kissing- I blame hormones on that- holding her, its    just scary    its wrong
On the ride home from the theater, I paid little attention to the    conversation, so distracted I was by thoughts like these
At that moment I    was filled with a nearly irrepressible thought of bringing my arm around    her back, and pulling her closer, leaning into her
BUT
her brother was on that side, might give him an accidental poke,    and her father
I kept an eye on the rear view mirror, where I watched his    eyes
I think that might have slightly made him suspicious, but I was    caught up in my mission of both controlling myself, and keeping the    possibility of losing it open from other interferences
Stupid dads, always ruining everything
But somehow, I "know" that if it stops, I'll miss it
If it stops, I'll wish it didn't, ill be left all alone there, in the    dark
I wish I at least knew HOW to do any of it, if not SHOULD I do it     Humans are awkward, bumbling machines
I also
see temptation at every turn
I've been told things, things I    never cared about until now
Things about people who have "mad raving    crushes" on me
Or at least "think I'm cute"     It's just too much for me
Especially that I don't have any time for it
I wish I did
I wish I just had some time, to talk
Just an hour, where I could stop    lying and hiding, and let SOMEONE know how I Really felt
I wish I could
But for now, all I can do is tell my story to the invisible shadows in my    computer, hoping someone stumbles on them, and can tell my story with such    bravery and valor that it almost makes up for revealing my secrets
If they did, I SHOULD thank them, but I'm CLEARLY insane in my writings     Or obsessed
But then again, in circumstances such as mine, who isn't
This was WRITTEN on Nov
7-9 Took me a while to write, but its pretty good     Too bad nobody's read this except for You and Val (who was having    nightmare issues)     Yes, I REALLY did think that "the grudge" was that scary
Lots of big words, along with my usual amount of metaphors and such     November 9th, one month ago yesterday
meaning our "one month" was    like
already passed
I only remembered because of my crazy thinking    ways
THAT's a good story
Marissa Greco     October 24, 2006     Junk Essay                               A Valentines Day Treat     Deep in the vast jungle that flourishes under my bed is a lonely box
But    this gift box is no ordinary treasure
The writing of my aunt Jitka meets    me as I pull the package out from the wilderness, a layer of dust    sprinkling its top like freshly fallen snow- the snow typical of    Valentines Day
I can just distinguish my aunt's uppercase mature    handwriting reading "To Marissa on her 7th Birthday
As I blow away the dust and open the box I catch the reflection    of a blue glass
I briefly recall the boy who gave me the necklace in the    October of sixth grade
But this isn't what grasps my attention the most
Stowed quietly under the flowing love letters and carefully placed    trinkets lies a smaller, heart shaped box
A flood of emotions encompasses    me as I remove the other treasured contents
I recall my first Valentines    Day box of chocolates, from a boy
February 14, 2004, a Wednesday that will remain in my heart forever
To    tell you the truth, there was nothing special about this day until I got    to school
The anxiety I felt beforehand however, was agonizing
Wednesday    was my least favorite day of the week as I had my Biology lab first    period, but today I was anxious to get to school- an event we know doesn't    happen often
Tuesday came to a close with a whisper from my boyfriend,    Colin, "I'll have a surprise for you
I pictured him ahead of me now, with his mushroom haircut, cattail    like fingers, and puppy- dog eyes
The biker with the yellow reflector    passed, each revolution of the pedals like a day at the Louvre for a    person unattached to art
I glimpsed the headlights of the bus in the    distance and heard the familiar rumble of its engine as it neared
The    yellow monster that gobbled me up in the morning and spat me out in the    afternoon had transformed
It was now a sunflower absorbing me, the rays    of the sun
After what seemed like hours of waiting through each of the    three lights on the way to school the doors of the sunflower widened and I    was free
I soon sped into the school and dashed down the never ending hallway to my    locker
I rushed through unpacking and hurried to drop my backpack in    homeroom
I chanced a nervous glance at the clock- 7:35
Good, ten minutes    until school would start
By now my emotions were swelling with    anticipation and I could feel my heart pounding in my throat
I hastened    to the hallway Colin's locker was in
Before I turned the corner, however,    I slowed to a saunter, making sure my hair and clothes were perfect
After    all, I didn't want anything to spoil my Valentines Day
When I rounded that corner I could see Colin's head slowly rising
Perfect, he just finished unpacking
I bounced down the hallway, pride    filling my heart as I saw him turn and beam
He walked toward me and I saw    him wipe his hands on his khaki pants, the ones that he should've thrown    out two or three years ago
We met more to Colin's side of the hallway
I    guess I was walking faster than I thought
After a brief embrace, he knelt    down and unzipped his backpack
I could hear the zipper travel over each    rung with lethargy I never imagined possible
Colin's reached into his    backpack and pulled out
a golden box of chocolates
The box had a    shiny red outline leaving one centimeter of golden border
On the front of    the box, "Hershey's" is written all in capital letters outlined in a shiny    red rectangle
This rectangle overlaps an oval in which the phrase, "Pot    of Gold" is written in flowery handwriting, the handwriting that companies    use to make the box more attractive to the buyer
As I open the box, the    smell of chocolate envelops me and I am in love
Nothing could separate me    from Colin
By now, the edges of the heart are worn from the numerous times I    wistfully opened it, trying to capture the feeling of February 14, 2004
Chocolate remnants from my greedy fingers are apparent towards the edges    of the box from the times when my fingers mechanically traced the heart's    outline
Like the box, Colin has been relinquished to the past but he will    always have a place in my heart and survive through the memory of this    box
Valentines days have come and gone but I will never forget the day    when I received my golden heart of chocolate, from a boy
After all, how    can you forget a "first"
I wonder if anyone else does this
but whenever we had x-c or track    related gatherings, and someone who said they would definitely make it    just didn't show up for like 20 minutes, we would invariably have this    conversation
You know how sometimes you say that you have to worry about me
When I saw your livejournal, and the things that spill out, the secrets,    the lies, the facades, I stopped, and really worried about you
It scared    me, the things that you wrote, and even if it was all made up, or    exaggerated past any remote truth, I was really worried about you
We all feel alone, I even came out with it with one of my writings, and    how I constantly felt so alone, and it got worse all the time, similar to    what you wrote
But for me, everyone was sitting right there for me, you,    Megan, Lisa, Kristin, our entire lunch table leapt up and saved me from    falling
I still remember what you said, the sound of it, how every word    was ever so slightly angered at it
You said, "I hate when people do    that
just assume that nobody else feels that way
If nothing else, it will always make me smile, because assume is such a    funny word
It makes an ASS out of U and ME
It seems like such a dumb idea, bringing it up
I'm sure that everyone    might say, "I feel bad for you, just because I know exactly what you    mean
I mean whoa
who's anorexic
I'm not    hungry, so I don't eat     One time, I was tired, so I took a nap
Makes sense
I'm tired-I take a    nap
Apparently, it proves that I'm on something     I am NOT getting cooked up MOM
Don't you hate it how your best isn't enough sometimes
How even when you    do everything you can, give it your all, practice day and night, nothing    goes right, and you end up failing
How sometimes, your body goes deviant,    and does whatever it feels like, no matter what you try to do
You're a very good person Maddie; we all know it, no matter what else    happens
Me, I'm a little sketchy
You always seem to know people so well
Especially me
imagine I have the whole stage all to myself and I'm doing whatever I want    to, and everyone has to look at me, I'll always want them to really put    their hearts into wanting to see me     I want applause, not the blank silence of coerced spectators, tied to    their chairs     I want controversy, not perfection     I want attention so badly, that I wrote to give my sincerest show of    empathy, but ended up talking about me     But  that's usually my way of handling things     I  don't even know whether I should send this or not           Dependence is a terrible thing, but we all want it, even just the    slightest bit     By sending this, I'd show my dependence on you, for entertainment, to    empty myself, etc
etc
By not sending it, though I'm not showing I  don't care, I'm showing    perfect indifference           So, what I'm  doing is my usual style of handling things, writing about    it
I guess when it comes down to stress; I handle everything like a    normal human being- for once
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral,    but cries when no-one's looking
I listen to punk-rock, not because I'm a    punk or a rocker, but because life is best described through a fuzzy    shield of anger
If you ask me, personally, I think "hold on" is a pretty crappy    anti-suicide song
It's very dark
What I think you'd need is a good,    simple melody saying basically "what about
the girl next door who's always walking me from my bus-stop
Then in the middle, it has a sort of screaming ranting thing going on
and goes back to something a little happier
Or, that song-light and day- that's a cool song
I love it     Maddie, what do you dream
Colors
Darkness
War
Cows
Greatness
When I sleep, I see nothing at all
But am always left with that    prevailing feeling that "this is the day," or "something's not quite    right"      Something usually isn't right, all the time
My last dream was so long ago
near the end of last year
it links up    with a good story, that ultimately leads up to me and Mario hooking up
nevermind
This whole thing started quite simply, like most things this
profound
It all began with guilt, as it usually does for me
Do you    ever remember me saying that you reading my livejournal all the time made    me feel guilty for not reading yours
Well, I went before, when I wasn't a    friend, but then, it all opened up to me
Suddenly, I was exposed to all these minute details, and intricate lies
All surrounding you, like I once did to myself
Pretty much all of last    year, except for lunch, was a lie for me
just hiding, playing it safe
So, reading all this it made me feel helpless to save you, or help in any    way, so far away from everything
When you talked about separating from    some friends to favor others, I felt like I was one of them, me pulling    away from you and Kristen, and most of our little lunch table, and just    jumping ship to a completely new group
I felt guilty, like I often do,    sometimes incorrectly, about all of it
I'm sorry, even if it wasn't me    doing the separating
I decided to do something about it
This whole thing started as a reply to    one of your updates, but I thought it better not to tell everyone around    some of this gooey, mushy stuff
Despite all of my strange, unusual    characteristics, deep down, I'm still a guy
I started transferring the    would-be comment to a mail, when a sudden idea hit me
I would make it a    big letter, and have everybody sign it, and it would be one gushingly huge    show of everyone's love and affection to you
That idea, sort of took off, but I got a writers block
And had to reveal    my plans to a few people before I intended to
It was somewhat strange,    talking about it
Everyone I talked to said it was a good idea, very    sweet, but had my same fear of how you would take it
It reminded me of    seeing Signs, how everyone said it wasn't scary, but I was frozen stiff    from it
It's actually more like our L
A
book or shaving than anything    else
The weird reactions, the doubt and uncertainty
Lisa thought it was    mostly just you PMS'ing online, but I discounted that idea
Over the summer, Manishika has become my sort of "spirit guide" like you    and the lunch table was before
She recommended that I do it, but keep it    to myself
and of course, you
I'm not good at keeping secrets, so, maybe, you already heard of this    whole thing coming to you
I feel like something's missing, like I haven't said enough, but at the    same time, it's too much, and too much off topic, and more about me than    anything else
It's like what I was saying about dependence; I think I just depend on you    to always be there
I don't know, but you always seem to have something good to say, no matter    how much saying it would take away from you
Maybe the cost is privacy, or    friends, or something you never saw coming
but on the plus side, you    get people like me to tell you that we care
To be forgotten is worse than    death

Cooked
stir fry anything:     cut stir-fry sized cubes (very small) out of your meat     add garlic (powder or real) soy sauce and black pepper     get a veggie of your choice (broccoli, asparagus, or green pepper)     cut, clean, take out seeds
if broccoli the "precook" in microwave     cook the meat fully (use oil in the bottom of the pan to prevent    sticking

You know what I was just thinking
When playing RPGs, the time that you're most likely to die is also the    time that you're least likely to save
because you're so involved in the    game at that moment
The thrill of being on the edge of death tends to override the fear of    dying and losing progress
it would be great if the game somehow knew    that your human nature would get in the way
Another thing is that it may be the fact that I seem to pretend that I    have a life, and a feverish dedication to one activity or another, the    fact is that I don't acutally like them that much
And also that no    improvement occoured because of my false reasons behind being alone
I get it now
The reason Marissa felt like that was because in the end, I    didn't have the focus and dedication to her love to work through any    obstacle
And that means that to me, She was not the one
Because, for the ONE, you would do anything for her
Even overcome who you    were root down on the inside
And no-one will realize the paradox of what I was just saying
Because    they are not high
And now we are in the loop
The loop in which you fall when you were high
Because you will try to document it, and never realize that that is it
That you have fallen into their trap again
And again immediately after
And after which you being to realize that you hands are not part of the    keyboard, silently urging you on and bringing out that fiendish devil    within you
Inside you
The one you had only just this morning thought to    unleash
You sat on the toilet, mostly to just avoid doing something
You hear a    whispering voice in the right side of your ear say "Jeffrayyyyyy"
But this     Maybe he excused himself because he was too bored to sit through me doing    a detailed analysis
That's what he would do
I once thought this way    (said by him on the other side of my memory
The one where me and ammaar    are walking back from Econ and he was telling me in the way of one who    tells a child
He said "but one day
you will
And when you do, it will    blow your mind
The only    way you could really blow my mind is if I figured out that you would blow    my mind is if on that day I discovered that you knew something that you    could have only know if you were high
But that is the loop I would be    saying
And you would say, nope, that's not the only loop
But it would be    the only loop that would be making sense if you were high
But right now    I'm realizing that I may be completely missing this entire paradigm, and    that would make sense
But that would only make sense, if you were high
And now I'm doing the loop again
Because now I'm remembering the last    time
A)     You would only assume that negative if you were not trust ful of me
That's what I was gettingto
Fucking facebook
this would only happen to me, if I were high
Did I say that outloud
Both of these things are so    ridiculous
Maybe
it's that kind of statement that really fucks you up
Because on the one hand, you really believed them, and on the other hand,    you understand that it's going to be humorously little in comparision on    the other end of sobriety
But how would you make that comparision, if you were never high
Because you would only not know if you were high
They would claim
And I would counter claim, the only way you could not know of Avi's    example was if you were not high
But
you just made that up
But did I
Maybe it happened when I was high, and I only just now    completely forgot what it was
I actually did, by the way
And you would only say that if you were high
but Since you forgot it in    the past, and we are further down in your future, when we are NOT high,    how would we know what ridiculousity factor made sense at the time
Also I    think we are in the loop
But I didn't actually learn that until I was in    level two, proving once again how terribly stupidly recusive being high    is
Because that loop would only make sense if you were an event/memory    that proved the existence by example of the loop exactly
And you wouldn't    have learned it quite yet, but yes, this is an example of a loop within a    loop as a mental example
It makes sense, I swear
Fuck, that's the only other explanation for that kind of retardedness
Unless they were plain awkward
Obviously you don't want them retarded either
Fuck, you're so retarded when you're    sober
The immense burn on those people will be totally    outstantial
That's outstanding and substantial
Try to keep up
They're only PRETENDING to be that stupid, so then    they can totally own you into thinking that a group lower than them    exists
But, in fact, no such group exists, and they are left figuring out    that if no group below them exists, then they are on the bottom
And if    one such group DID exist, then being high was either     Wait, now I seem to be proving that being high is on the bottom of the    group, and thinking they're looking down, when really they're looking up
And you're the ones on top of them, because you can see both them, their    feet, and the ground
You really know you're on top of them, and simply    using faulty logic when they were high
The logic that I have forgotten    the middle step to, and am now on the back path going back
But that is    also an example of an amount of time that I had forgotten that there was    another loop going back, and I will not know it because that is the loop
And it will constantly frustrate me
I now see that people will hate the selfish stoners, and it could    be me
I am exactly thinking into the pattern that is a negative    stereotype of what that is
And now I see evidence that only retarded people will seek the stereotype    classification of being on the bottom, and they'll be right
And I can't    believe I just said that
Wtf
Now I can't get it to flip back to normal
Fuck
This is so crazy
Maybe there is none
No, because this is currently new    territory
I have never thought about this before, or at least I have no    logs of it
So either I never thought about this or it is something    totally new
And the former implies stupidity
And there was as little    reccitaion of the loop just there
Proving once again that the loop exists    and continues on
right there folks
Moving back in "digressive recursion"     "what the fuck
Fuck
I was wondering if had drinken something, and then I couldn't remember    even holding anything in my hand as a liquid flowed down
Like, I had the    mental image of holding the cup and drinking, but the cup had been shopped    out
That kind of thing
It's fucking nuts
God, it's fucking annoying that the sakai adds your membership, and then    doesn't give any comfirmation
At least it confirms for the homework/important things I suppose
Hang on, I just learned that last sentence
I guess that means that you    drop in intelligence when high, and then it comes back, at least    partially
Possibly that partial is very small
That might be bad
And that's the thing, you have to confirm that you aren't getting ripped    off by asking for the maximum
That's what everyone else does
Unless they    either don't care or their THAT ok with you
That's why Chris Lin must    have been saying
Unless he was only doing that to confirm his own okness    with the other being that guy
Thus doing exactly the thing
This is crazy    circular logic
Fuckkkkk
Giving into that madness, that's what I was talking about before
I could    give in to the madness (Now coming full circle
Although, this explains    that it doesn't matter the position of the "start&end points" of the    circle, because you can start or end at any point
It is arbitrarily    chosen, but because )     I have now proven that you can go forward, past the normal level, during    the recovery time of being high (a dip in intelligence
Or possibly I am only remembering that I did not get htat    because I am just learning that now, and that is proving to me that I did    not already learn that
But that's because in normal circumstances there is never a dip
And now I    have just proven again that there Is a healthy dip below the norm when    high
Because I just proved that like 5 minutes ago
Unless, someone say    to me "I didn't guess that until just now
Either way, I win
As I was saying, I was sitting on a toilet, and I gave myself the    image of my inner self in chaos
The wildly fluctuating cycles of feeling    seemed normal enough, but they really weren't
I was going crazy, crazy    crazy
If you    don't get it, you're not gay
Fuck
I don't get it
Or maybe I did    for a second
But then that would mean the fluctition between gay and not,    which is much more than is preferable
I would like constantly 0
WTF,    this has taken a weird turn
Fuckk
So horny
No joke
This is    ridiculous
So absurd
And isnt' it your DUTY to capture the evil, and store it for all time
To    give your evil form, for the sake if science
To really WANT to see this    limit of strangeness, and even encourage it
To Not only encourage it and    observe, but to document and share, and turn this maddening chaos into    evidence, and more intense drama
To fuel the fire in a direction that    nobody knows is real or not, and push it anywhere, but to the center
And I was thinking this on the toilet
That I would actually want this    chaos
I think I was wrong
That's ridiculous
But at the same time, if    felt a creature within me stirring
I had given my madness an ounce of    freedom, and it made my blood burn
I felt something deep within me    stirring and stirring
And as I channeled it into my hands and face and    heart, I felt happy
I felt power
of evil"
And it vanished
NO, I did not want this power
Not of evil
That's definitely not true
But for the ONE, would you steep yourself in it
Isn't that what she would    be mad at
To literally fall all the way down
No good Christian would do that
In    essence, she was telling me that I was not the ONE, because she would    never do that for me
But doesn't that just mean that every Christian    Literally loves Christ more than they love their spouses
That's    impossible
The opposite is true in most chick flicks
So
does that    mean that any smart girl would not be watching chick flicks, because they    would be not feeling the same way
That sucks
Perhaps my lack of faith is    making me less "macho", and has lead directly to my liking of girly    things
That logical pathway definitely exists     But that's just the argument
Although that pathway does exist, it is not    the statistically highest one
It's much more probable that my tendencies    are from something else
And that's why we should have a moonbase for our    testing
Fuck
that sounds so like what I normally say, but is so random
Geez, does that mean that people think I'm high all the time
Thursday 1:51 AM, September 25, 2008
I wonder how many times in high school I could blow off a project    completely, and get away with it
I remember once, I was supposed to write    the last page of my essay when an interesting idea struck me
I spent 4    hours writing what I wanted to
staying up ridiculously late, but much    happier now doing something I wanted to
I wrote at least 2 pages, single    spaced, before running out of steam and winding it down
When I flipped    back to what I was supposed to be doing (with a sigh, and an internal    "This sucks
Why do I have to do this stupid paper anyway
I quickly bs'ed an extra body paragraph and conclusion before going    to bed
It eventually got even worse
My finest moment was staying up until 4 am    reading comics and watching anime and movies
before deciding that doing    homework sucked ass and going to bed without doing the paper
The class period came, and the teacher wasn't in
Score
By and by, senior year came, and I wrote almost my entire Stats Final    Project during a half day of school, frantically hopping from class to    class trying to find computers to work on
And got a high B, I think
Good    thing too, because that was pretty much the only grade going into the 4th    marking period
Most often, I would get deep into a paper, but unmotivated to finish, I    would spend hours doing random stuff, until somewhat ridiculous times in    the morning, and then realize I had only the finishing touches to do
But, though I feel strongly that I've given up on at least a few    occasions, the only things that come to mind are when I'm reading    something and make the conscious decision to go to sleep instead of    reading
I remember giving up
but can't find a single example
And I want to give up now
But I know it's not too far away, and there's a nice comfy bed waiting on    the other side
But the essay
its just so large and in the way

Motives of a Period
Obviously a period just wants to end things
It comes at the end of a    sentence
Oh
wait, not that kind of period
Oh
the school period
Gotcha now
Let me start over
Obviously, I want a period to end as soon as possible
Then comes the end    of the day
In case you're not as observant as Steph Yang, I should tell you    that I don't understand girls
Nothing new
I mean, I'm in high    school
it's pretty common
1/18/09     I wonder how much of your voice would be transmitted through your body to    random body parts
For example, your middle finger
How much of an increase in "volume" would    your finger experience when you talk
Also, discounting how much that    transfers through the air
First, you would have to establish the baseline volume of your finger    under normal circumstances
Just hook up a machine that would read the    vibrations coming from your finger VERY accurately, and leave it running    as the subject sits for about 5 minutes doing nothing
Then, during the actual test, the subject begins talking at their normal    level, and continues a one-sided conversation for a bit
The machine will    read the vibrations that are coming from the finger, and also, a control    machine will read the vibrations coming through the air
It should be a simple matter of subtracting
BUT, what about other volumes
Whispers, Yelling, Singing, etc
In addition, has the control really accounted for everything
Hmmmmm
I think it has
What I need to do soon     -first

is mostly just like
yeah and im sure    that i love you too
not     Madlo456: that didn't even make sense :-(     Jeffrey63090: it would help if it had quots     Jeffrey63090: "yeah im sure, and say
if i were like that, this would    be where i say, 'love you too' "     Jeffrey63090:
except the other example was more like you     Jeffrey63090: the one that happened in my head     Madlo456: haha     Madlo456: well of course I flirt when I choose to, I'm just saying I don't    in conversation     Madlo456: it's code to flirt with one's boyfriend     Jeffrey63090: i never noticed     Madlo456: it's just what's done     Jeffrey63090:

Madlo456: you really didn't think I'm quiet in school
Jeffrey63090: i think im losing     Madlo456: the flirtwar

it is    true)     Jeffrey63090:
i never noticed     Jeffrey63090: i think quiet people have more     Madlo456: nah     Madlo456: I doubt that     Madlo456: I'm not a quiet person, I'm just quiet in school     Madlo456: which means, I eat healthy food plus junk food     Madlo456: snap     Madlo456: I'm tired and you have made no progress     Madlo456: goodnight     Jeffrey63090: oh     Jeffrey63090: thats what u thing     Jeffrey63090: k     Madlo456: gosh I was just about to sign off also     Madlo456: then what progress did you make jeff

i mean     i'm not interrupting

11:35pmElise     no
haha     11:35pmJeffrey     oh ok     also     i know i hate it when people toy with me     but
i also love it     11:36pmElise     hahah well you do your fair share of toying too     11:36pmJeffrey     i know
11:36pmElise     hahah     hahah     11:36pmJeffrey     i'm a little worried though     11:36pmElise     about what
11:36pmJeffrey     does toying with you every now and then     make me evil
11:36pmElise     of corse not
haha     11:36pmJeffrey     hmmm     what if i'm toying with you     ALL the time
11:37pmElise     haha it might be a little frustrating or confusing at times
but it doesnt    make you evil
haha     11:37pmJeffrey     hmmmmm     hmmmmm     hmmmm     but certainly     what keeps me coming back to you     are the little things you do     that are definately mucking about in my head     11:39pmElise     hahah is that a good thing
when i try to leave, and you really really really look like you    want a goodbye kiss
but, for no reason at all, i feel like i don't want    to give you one
that sort of thing     is great
11:39pmElise     hahaha oh really     11:39pmJeffrey     yes
but     i think it's fun     and also     totally evil     11:40pmElise     and youre sure its for no reason at all
and youre sure its for no reason at all
11:40pmJeffrey     no, i have reasons     most of them     are because i think it might be evil     11:41pmElise     hahaha well if you think youre evil
it might make you evil
but if you    dont want to be evil
you dont have to be
ha     11:41pmJeffrey     yes     but also
i want to be with you     which is
evil
not sure why     hmmmmmmmmmm     hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm     11:43pmElise     i wouldnt say its evil
hah i want to be with you too
but the only thing    holding me back is that youre in college and im still in high school
i    dont want it to be an issue
but for some evil reason it is
i wouldnt say its evil
hah i want to be with you too
but the only thing    holding me back is that youre in college and im still in high school
i    dont want it to be an issue
but for some evil reason it is
11:43pmJeffrey     hey
wait     problem for you     or for me     or
like, your parents     11:44pmElise
mostly my parents
well actually mostly meaning like 100% my    parents
but its not you
its just in general     11:45pmJeffrey     yeah, i've never met a girl's parents that wanted their daughter to date     except for koreans     but they only want other koreans     so
not me     yay racism
11:46pmElise     well they will let me date
they just dont want me to date guys in    college
hahah oh jeff     11:46pmJeffrey     Elise is no longer online
The following was not sent:     hey, no way (send as a message)     11:48pmElise is online
11:48pmJeffrey     age-ism is cool too
but also, most of the reason we are just close,    personal friends right now is because i wanted to sort out whether or not    it's totally creepy for me to be dating someone as young as you
and i    decided that it wouldn't be as long as i
fixed some things first     and, the most important of those things
was the issue of me playing    with you
11:49pmElise     i totally understand with that idea     11:49pmJeffrey     because, if we were the same age
it's finnnneeeee to toy with your    feelings to see what will happen     11:49pmElise     haha yes     11:49pmJeffrey     but
since i'm older     its
not good at all
because
i donno why     but it isn't fine at all
11:49pmElise     ha very true i understand     age sucks
11:50pmJeffrey     but i definately can't change the fact that i want to play with you
but
if you're fine with that too
then this could work
except now your parents might be in the way     11:51pmElise     hahaha yea my parents would definatly find a way to be in the way
so if we were going out
are we looking at a relationship
or like just    being together for like hook ups and stuff
11:52pmJeffrey     geez, i think you have the wrong idea of what i mean by "playing with"     11:52pmElise     hahah nooo i understand
i think     11:52pmJeffrey     i'm really not that perverted elise     11:52pmElise     im just wondering     haha i know
11:53pmJeffrey     well, the way i've always seen it     is that first, and above EVERYTHING     we will be close, personal friends     11:54pmElise     i like that
11:54pmJeffrey     i think     you think     i'm a terrible person
believe me
if i thought you were a terrible person
i wouldnt ever want    to hang out with you
11:55pmJeffrey     lol that's not true
i love hanging out with terrible people     11:55pmElise     or anything     11:55pmJeffrey     its so crazy all the time
oh     yeah, i don't think i would generally "or anything" with terrible people     actually
that would be crazy too
11:56pmElise     hahah seeeeeee     11:56pmJeffrey     nope
lol     hmmmmmmmmmmmmm     11:56pmElise     hahaaha oh jeff     11:56pmJeffrey     i think     uhhh, this might sound terrible     11:57pmElise     yes
11:57pmJeffrey     but i generally didn't hang out with you very often, except when we were    dating, since going to college     and
does that mean, that     historically     i've only been with you for hooking up and stuff
grrrrrrrr     i guess so     lol     damn     well,     11:58pmElise     i dont know about that
cause i mean its not like thats the only thing we    did when we went places
cause we went to the movies     11:58pmJeffrey     i'm stumpted     11:58pmElise     and such     11:59pmJeffrey     yeah     but that's like     typical bf/gf things     11:59pmElise     so its all good then
hah     11:59pmJeffrey     oh
Today     11:59pmJeffrey     ok     11:59pmElise     right
11:59pmJeffrey     yes

hah thanks
I often had wanted to write a book, but I am not the type of writer that    can go in depth about a subject for more than a page or two
As of today,    my longest has been 4 pages, a full and complete story of the numerous    emotions and overwhelming fear of my first date
Sad isn't it
Before it seemed like a waste of time to just go on and on with one thing
I don't know why but it seems like I'm full of complete opposites: I can    summarize the world into a sentence, but my stories drag on excessively
She's the only one I ever tried this hard for, and failed this miserably    with
I could have anything I wanted, but instead I screw myself over
So here it is, another test of my own will
To turn 4 hours of life into    four hours of paper
At least four pages, and with a distant fantasy goal    of twenty, to make a sitting novel out of a single experience
I could do    it too, the thing is packed with so many other meanings, but the memory    fades so quick when called to mind, it seems better to just leave it and    let it slip slowly than all at once
The pain is easier, but just as    intense
There was so much to do, it's hard to figure out what I'm doing and it's    hard to find the reason why
I did my homework, I washed my face, I shaved    the shadow around my mouth, and all of it was completely unnecessary
Back    when we were more, it would have been in my even going hope of me being    with her
It would have been done for the chance for a kiss or more
It    would have been done with full reasoning, the necessity of being perfect    all for her
But it would seem strange to anyone else, because we never    did anything
I would tear at myself from the inside seeking to have her    as my own, and never make a move
I would destroy my soul in agony    afterward, but act the same the next time
I would try my absolute hardest    in both directions, and the one which had a goal of not moving would be    the one to win
So then here I was, months after she had left me, with the same anxiety    deep within and it was still as obvious to all, but the two of us that it    would matter to
Everything was ready
We left
The strain against myself    began
I wanted to talk to my dad about it, tell him that he wasn't just    my ride over, but I sat silently
I wanted to strike up some sort of    conversation, but I looked out the window and listened to the radio
I    idly played with the oversized "Bed, Bath, and Beyond" bag that held    everything I would need to study Chem with (for)
I knew that this would    end rather inconveniently with a great deal of flirting instead of work,    but I always know what I'm getting into right before I do it anyway
It's    not the greatest policy, but at the very least I'm not lying when I say "I    knew that would happen" when all goes to hell and I stand dumb watching    it
That's a pretty picture, me standing amid great flames, and saying with a    sarcastic smile that it really was all my fault- that if I wanted to I    could have avoided all the pain and confusion
I should have spared    everyone the trouble
But I ALWAYS do it anyway
Come to think of it, that car was seriously BLAZING hot
A few minutes    more and I would have broken out sweating everywhere
It's a good thing we don't live in an age where these things would kill    you
Were I born in the past, I would be a much better man
The person I    am now, seems like just a piece of who I could be, but it's just the piece    that doesn't seem to be able to grow
So we enter the abyss, and I say the tiniest fragment of what I mean when    I say "so I'll call you, thanks" to my dad
I enter her house
I think as I walking up to her door, about what Ben had said, that I am    seriously the most rude person for being comfortable enough with others    that I feel nothing about just coming into their house from whatever door    is open
As I go up to the door, my feet slip
The clear ice had been    unnoticed, but I don't have any effect other than the effortless sudden    teleportation about two inches forward
I walk on with my books and    awkwardly enter the house
The door usually just opens as I approach, to her friendly smile
But this    time the house is empty and depressed
Holly, their beautifully golden    dog, but rather obese dog, looks at me and slowly meanders over to me
With this greeting party, I finally take my first step inside
I take off    my shoes and scratch her on the head, noting her recent slimness
She's    getting old, and I thought about how she's dying
She's had two strokes    recently, and I wondered at the quality of her vision currently
I go over to the table to drop off my books somewhat confusedly
My jacket    is still on, but its nice to be able to be able to take that off without    the burden of holding the books awkwardly
Even so, it seemed very much    like I was doing thing out of order, like I was getting completely lost    when really it's the most logical thing to do
I had just helped myself to    looking around, when she popped out of nowhere, wearing a rather    attractive and minorly revealing tank top
The old feelings came back on    me, but in a very small dose this time
I felt physically drawn to her,    but it was easy to resist the annoyance like one does a gentle breeze
I    immediately noticed the picture of her: a mugshot from the newspaper on    the best x-c runners this year
Her hair was slightly poofed out, not unusual, and she had the same smile    as always, just a bit bigger
I pointed it out and glanced sideways at it
There was something wrong, maybe missing
Something wasn't quite right    about it, but I didn't get the chance to see what, as a sigh and "oh darn"    came across
Her hand slapped against the wall where the article was hung
She reminded me about picking up some    clothes from her, so I just murmured "yeah" as I became aware she was    pressing in on me slowly
I've noticed it's a lot easier to deal with things all at once rather than    over time
I don't know, maybe I'm just getting all confused, but when    things slip slowly, its harder to try and get a grip than when you need to    pull it together at that very second
She slipped in on me slowly, and now    I'm hooked
Then again, in the beginning, I thought, "This will not end    well
I had    been doing stupid chemistry ALL day, and had only finished half
The    problems were so long and numerous it seemed like they would never end
Whatever was next, I needed some graph paper
have any graph paper
using me as always
A while ago, I accused her of not wearing a bra for seriously the whole    week
At the time she sort of gave me this smile that said, "glad you    noticed," and sighed
Complaining is an entirely different thing than just    noticing
I wasn't complaining
I pulled up to her, and loosened her    sweater around her shoulder, revealing it
Despite the proximity, I felt    nothing but the satisfaction of knowing she was still attached to me
She sighed, and pulled me closer
Whispering, she moved her lips up to my    ear
They have these    thingies
We were headed for the stairs I realized when I got around to thinking of    exactly why we were slipping away through this strange route
This seemed    strange to me to say the least
It was supposedly "illegal" for her to    have boys upstairs, I had been told
As I slightly reluctantly followed, I    realized that it probably only applied to boyfriends, which I was no    longer
Now that I think about it, no matter how good this one may seem,    she never had much respect for letting rules get in the way of what she    wanted
As we went up to her room, things seemed increasingly strange
We sat on her bed
What can I say
Well its like this, when invited to a    girl's bedroom, and onto her bed, what position am I in to say no
Ok    maybe I did enjoy the illegality of it all, but whatever
The point is, I    knew where this was going, and did absolutely nothing about it
I thought    "aren't boys not supposed to be here
It was just    a gentle breeze, a quite protest to the sharply declining course
We were    going down and I wasn't planning on saying a word
We broke out the notes and began
I was lagging a bit behind, and really had    no idea how to do what she wanted
I looked at it for a second and    immediately remembered
I knew what I was doing now
Why would she do this to me
Like you know how I say like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of puns,    and then you get it and do it back to me
She just kept loving me and loving me and loving me, and now look what she    did
Why does she have to do this to me
Its not fair
She should be
nicer
Sigh
I guess I'll have to explain all this
Well, we were studying
And    at first she was sitting at the head of her bed, and facing the foot, and    I was on the side near the foot, stretched out across the baseboard
That's the way it SHOULD have stayed
Of course I noted that I should    never even consider going over to her side of the bed, but you know how I    am
Just watch myself fall, and never even speak up
Marissa's mom came in
I felt the panic when you get caught sneaking    around, but you weren't really doing anything you weren't supposed to, it    just looks funny
Its like getting shocked by electricity, and you get the    most amazing burst of speed on the inside, tensing for action- and then    realizing you haven't done anything
As she looked in on us, me in a    rather compromising situation, I panicked, and was about to jump off the    bed announcing "I didn't do anything
I opened my mouth and
Marissa cut me off
At first we were all business
How do you do this
Just do this
How do    you do this
Just do this
Whats this mean
This, this and this
But this    method required lots of talking, pointing, etc
with the same book
That    lent itself to lots of abuses from a certain flirty girl
That spells trouble when particularly trying to avoid    contact with someone
We would find each others hands on pages, find each others bodys when    looking for a page
And boy, were there puns
More importantly was massive, unavoidable flirting
The way a 1st grader would flirt, would be by annoyances
Some strange    logic thingie, but it seems to work
That, and I'm stuck in the first    grade
The oversized bag became the flirt-tool of choice for a five minute    span
Sigh "that bag is SO annoying" Marissa leans WAY over and grabs it
In the    process she twists her body in JUST the right way to completely obliterate    my mind and turn me into a drooling, horny caveman
As she neatly, and    quite annoyingly folds it, I return to whatever passes as normal inside my    mind, and the usual half-baked ideas come popping to mind
Plus it was    really annoying how she has to be such a neat freak
you mean like this
I casually flip the corner of it, and she sighs,    whines and moans about it as she seductively crawls toward me and flips it    back
I doubt she had any clue how amazing she was at that moment
this bothers you
Marissa has this nice tendency of giving me exactly what I want, and then    taking it all away
This time as she reached for the bag, she twisted in    possibly the only way that would show absolutely no skin
I felt the most    amazing anger at myself for letting my hopes go so high
Probably without    even meaning to, she gave me nothing and made me realize how much I    suddenly wanted her
Somehow, I found myself perpendicular to her with the book, about 2 feet    closer than I started
We were talking about some silly chemistry thing,    and her hand found mine again
This time, my body no longer strained    against itself, or her
When the body is in danger, it knows there's no    time to screw around waging its own civil war
Every piece of me knew this    was trouble, so I slid out of her hand, making some useless gesture
This lioness was the most stubborn ass ever to be made from a couple of    humans
Some people just never give up, and some people are sane
Within    the next five minutes, her hand slipped onto my knee
The only way to get    it off is obviously to push it off
I hate it when everyone else has a    better plan than I do
She grabs my hand as it pushes hers off my knee
What a freaking cheater
The danger seems to pass, and only do I realize    to get my hand out a few seconds later when I suddenly need my hand for    something, but I don't seem to want to move it
Another hand on top is a    lot more weight than one would think
By the way, holding hands is fun,    and should be done as often as conveniently possible
This was rather    inconvenient
I can't get back together with her, we ended a long time    ago
She did it all, and she can't just go and pick us up where we left    off
I don't have any idea why not, but that's what seems right
I also have one little problem, a pact with myself not to get involved    with anything for what seems now like a very, very long time
Basically,    one could say that after I was dumped, I fell
While falling it thought it    might just be much easier to make it my goal to stay down and out of    trouble
Now heres the clincher: Marissa decides to pick up where we left    of, begins to massively flirt with me, and is basically going smoothly in    exactly the direction that I would like
But as she tries to take my hand    and pick me up, I pull back and close my eyes- determined to just sit on    my ass and refuse
She scoots closer
Her legs slide against mine
The book of science is my    only ticket out
I yammer absently about some random fact with entirely    too many glaring grammatical errors for me to be considered sober
Its    hard to keep even the slightest grip on what I'm doing when what I'm    really doing is wishing that I could curl up next to her and just please    her the way she's asking
Something related to electrons
Chemistry
Orbitals and hybridization
Ions
I don't know, none of it    really makes sense, and yet here I am on Marissa's bed telling her every    fuzzy detail my foggy brain can come up with
Marissa doesn't make sense,    but neither do I
I begin to doubt my capacity to fluently speak English    any longer
It's all just a mess
All I can think about is her, but I'm    trying so hard not to
All I want is her, but I refuse to reach out and    try
And through it all, I have an overwhelming feeling like I shouldn't    be here, that this is not a good place to be
I guess she noticed I wasn't really able to get a grip anymore, because    she suddenly saved me by saying "So do you still need that skirt
Well, the thing about swim team is that we are all utterly insane, and    strangely normal
I hate it when that happens, because its just another    sign that I'm going crazy, and I was never that normal to begin with
Wait
what
Anyways, the point is that I had the whole thing planned out in my mind
I    would wear her grey, frilly skirt
It would be a sick twist from how hot    she usually looked in it
My hair was growing out, and I hoped to talk my    way into a long, feminine cut
The skirt would be a step up from last    year's conservative one, and show a disturbing amount of skin
The tank    top and light sweater would be a disgusting twist on the image of    Marissa's beauty
So when Marissa offered another skirt, lets just say she knew my    expression well enough to guess exactly what I had in mind
She sighed as    she took out the one I dubbed "the hot one
First the pretty skirt
Then a bright tank top
Finally the sweater    for the closing touch
The skirt I tried on first
I used her closet, and felt a bit odd
I    laughed inside on being the first guy to undress in her room
It fit well,    and I showed it off to her
I felt pretty weird wearing her skirt, because    I felt all flirty and giggly
Plus, if I'm wearing her skirt, it kind of    means I'm holding my pants
And all of this done in her room
Next I discovered the secrets of femininity
The tank top is the girl's    best weapon
There's something incredibly seductive about Marissa when she    wears them
Possibly the fact that despite being so smart, and often times    masculine, she was still amazingly hot
When she showed that much skin,    there was really no way I would even stand a chance
Every time she wore a    tank top, though usually covered by another shirt, I always felt like she    were pulling me in and inviting me to just wrap my arms around her
At her    locker, I always felt the familiar torture of wanting to hold her, to kiss    her, and knowing that I couldn't
There was one lying on the foot of her bed
And of course the one she was    wearing (hotness
I look at it for a second, and compare it to my body    size
I immediately felt a    rush of wicked laugh coming on
I grinned
The laugh stopped, got confused    in my throat, and became a rather befuddled
Easier said    than done
When lacking a sleeve, the difference between an arm hole and a    head hole is about a centimeter and a lot of confusion
After staring at    it a bit, and her helpful warning "you have it backwards", I pulled it    over my head
I'm stuck
Crap
What do I do now
I feel a bit of a panic as I struggle gently with the clothes
Some odd    flappy-do is clinging to my face, and I have really no clue what's going    on
As I continue to try and fix myself, I find myself slowly getting off    balance
Naturally, the only thing left to do is flail around with every    one of my limbs and figure out some way to fix myself through sheer dumb    luck
It works better than one would think
Wiggling slightly, I start to    really panic
I'm about to just start freaking out and hope for the best    when Marissa's hand is suddenly on my elbow
With my heart skipping a    beat, every worry suddenly dissolves and control of my legs and start    falling over again
One could say I was falling in love
She gently and patiently got me sorted out
The clinging flap was that    built in bra thingie, and she held me up as she reached her hand up my
tank top
and pulled it down around my
breasts
Yeah
Anyway, I'm left with my heart pounding from the panic, in a set of very    flirty clothes, and right beside a woman I have loved
Is it really my    fault when I start flirting with her
I giggle a few times and mosey on    over to her, rubbing her body
She looks up at me with these eyes, like a dog begging for some deeply    desired thing
Her eyes are all shiny and the weight of our proximity is    crushing me
At the same time as I feel crushed, it feels like I'm going    to die from my heart exploding
I draw in to her and brush her leg with    mine
I slide off her sweater and the throb of my heart becomes painful    with the revealing of her wonderful shoulders and back
Somehow the simple    embrace I told my body to do becomes so much more
My hands at her waist,    she reaches her arms around my neck gently and the pain in my heart    increases
I feel sort of like I'm going insane, because I'm suddenly    dizzy and my body is acting on its own
Her body pulls up to mine, and mine to her, and in the corner of my mind I    think that this is somehow a bad idea
It also would occur to me that she    wasn't acting by her own free will either
When our lips first meet, it's with the slightest touch
Where this is    going, I don't know
Still, I feel a shivery feeling all over my body, and    my bare arms suddenly get goosebumps
Her body is warm, so I see no    problem with wrapping my arms tighter around her
She pulls closer to me    too, but she is kissing me passionately now
Chills run down my spine and    I feel an electric thrill run back up it in response
Her mouth is a masterpiece of nature
I once wondered why she has the    habit of licking her lips so often
If I had lips like hers, I'd want to    lick them often to
It seems a weird thing to do, but with someone like her, it was all too    natural
Apparently she didn't think so
Enjoying myself thoroughly, I was    a bit put off when she slid her lips around my tongue to reach my lips
I    press hard against her, and my hands sparkle with electricity as I hold    her close
It was everything I ever wanted and more
Her tongue embraced    mine, and I knew it couldn't get any better than this
I feel suddenly like I'm on fire as she pushes me to her bed
The books    scatter and make way for our two bodies
As she pulls back
I open my eyes    and realize that she's so fantastically beautiful
I didn't even realize    the half of it
I feel sudden elation
And now we're making out on her bed again
I suddenly realize that it's not like the movies show at all
The truth    is, I felt so extraordinarily confused the entire time
It's like when I    first started smoking pot
I had no idea why I was doing it, it was just    something I was doing
From the first time it touches your lips, you feel    like you're torn from both sides
It's the best feeling in the world- the    happiness and wanting, all while you know that you shouldn't be doing it
Her body is like sand, but heavenly smoothed
She's covered in the most    attractive spots and freckles, yet pale and white overall
She is the    image of beauty, and now she is all mine
I move down her amazing body,    leaving a kiss everywhere I go
I take special care with the belly I had    so often wanted to hold
She was wearing loose sweatpants
They easily    slid off
I laughed at Jamie for buying it, and thought it was    tremendously funny
She presses back for a second, and gives me the funny look of doom
The    joke was over, but the feeling lingered
I take a step back and suddenly    note the tightness around my chest
Of course, I attribute it to the tank    top
At first, I was sort of planning on using one of my sweaters to keep    it legal within school rules, but when I saw myself with this for the    first time, I really thought it would ruin the whole thing
I put on her sweater and the outfit is complete
Wearing her clothes    suddenly made me feel closer to her
It turns out that taking a tank top off, especially a tight one, is just    as hard as putting one on
This time, I plan on having a full set of    directions before trying anything
how do you do this
Sigh
take it off
I'm standing here in woman's clothing
in her bedroom,    asking her to help me take it off
and then take your other hand and    just
Her soft, pale skin seems to shine, but only holds a    fraction of the allure it once had
Or maybe I was just closer before
Just pull hand out
Take other hand
Huhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ok
I really have    no idea what's going on
so I just keep watching her
We were in your bedroom again
I guess I never noticed until now, but you did what I always did: open the    door, but not invite anyone in
If we both just listened to all the    millions of little hints like this
But no, the response was just a little stare, and you said "forget it" and    the door slammed in my face
So here I go: take hand out, bring hand down, pull up
I sort of struggle    to get the whole thing up, around and over my shoulders and head
When    being stretched to the limit, things are bound to start snapping
As the    snap and crackle of the ties breaking were heard, we were caught off guard    and it was permanently just that much weaker
She looked at me accusingly,    but nobody could really tell the difference between when it was broken and    whole
With nothing covering me, I involuntarily tensed and pulled my arms in,    against the chill of the outside world
Well hardy har har, I    thought, but in spite myself I felt kind of warmer, like I was blushing on    the inside
On the outside, I was the perfect image of Vincent
I gave her    a condescending look, while it was clear that I was enjoying the    attention
As I put on my normal shirt, I asked if she had anything a bit
less    tight
I realized it was kind of a silly question, because obviously she's    the same size for all of her clothes, with the exception of old ones
Well, clearly it wasn't a normal day
Pulling out another tank top, she    pointed out to it being an old one
Though usually old implies too small    to wear, this apparently meant stretched out
This girl clothes thing is    weird
Going back to her closet to change, I really wanted her to turn away
Like    there was even a chance she could see me though her closet door and from    across the room anyway
I came back out and neatly put everything out in    perfect order
The shirt, the skirt, and
well Marissa took back her    sweater so she could wear it still during the week
After Marissa    complained, I took them out of their perfect order and off the hanger to    fold them
They rested on the bed corner as we resumed work
They took up    even more of my dwindling personal space
I thought back    to long, long ago
We both owed each other so much
For the hugs in the    beginning, for the kisses in the middle, and for the time at the end
I    thought about all of this, and just looked at her for a second, thinking    about what it would be like to pay back all that debt
Things play out in    my mind a bit like things would be if I were stronger
My shoulders hunched as I took the few steps    to her
I kissed her once
but it was a great debt
All of those times that I    had denied her, that I held back next to her came suddenly pouring out
She surged back in response, and for a moment I had the serious fear that    I would have to keep kissing her forever, never able to repay the debt
Its hard to worry when you're not in a real world, and clearly being with    her after so long was not something real
After a minute or two, I had the    feeling that everything was balanced, that everything was as it should be
I pulled back for a second and looked at her
She always gives me those    eyes like she wants something, and I always feel it too
I let the dream    fade away and focus once again to the task at hand
Whenever Marissa makes a bet with me
I always seem to win
I don't know    why she still bothers
In any case, I suddenly find myself $10 richer
However, to Marissa,    that's just chump change
I suddenly discover she's loaded to the brim    with moolah shoving out of every crack in her room
She takes a step over    to her dresser and picks up a small bag with a large M on it
I think immediately of her attractive tank top- the one with the M on the    breast, that you can almost, but not quite, feel guiltless peeking at    every now and then
There's something about her in those tank tops, which    just pull on you
like the edge of a cliff to a depressed man
Somewhere    inside, all sorts of alarms ring and warn you that this is a horrible    idea, but you're just drawn in anyway
You inch to the edge of the world    and look out, thinking of the beautiful oblivion you could have
If you    just took the last step
Everything could be just so perfect
You just    take one step closer and you can touch infinity
But deep inside you know it would be the end of you
She opens the bag and digs around for the amount owed
Thousands of bills    float about like a tiny sea of green
She finds what she's looking for and    crumples it in her hand
With a fox-like grin she meanders over and puts    the bag back
I think of her cat as she walks back, moving like she could    bring the world closer to her if she had wanted to, but just walked to    spite the world
Even her clothes mimicked the way a cat's skin moves    about like a separate animal
I hold out my hand and she seizes the    opportunity to play one more game with me
Slowly she unravels the bill,    and shows that its just a one
Tempting me, she tells me to come and get it
After a few lame attempts to    snatch it from her hand, I easily grab the hand she trickily "let" me    have
Giggling, she begins to pull her arms away from me, and reels me in    until I'm lying next to her
Facing the wall, she tests my limits
I sigh
Why do girls always think    putting bills down their shirt will STOP anybody
It's a very good excuse    to go digging
Especially with someone like Marissa
Its times like these that I would always look back on and think to myself,    "sometimes you are such a brainless moron
but lucky as hell
lets see
nothing
I think it's fair to say this    was handled better than usual
She seemed to throw every girlish obstacle in my way, the kind of feeble    attempts at stopping someone you would give when telling someone cute to    stop flirting with you
Well gee, isn't that completely unlike anything    else that happened that day
She pushed my body away with hers, but only succeeded in pressing lovingly    against me
She grabbed at my hand, but it felt like she was shoving it    into her shirt
She laughed and screamed, urging me
Finally, she pressed    her shoulders together, trying to shut me out of her shirt, but it just    pressed more and more of her skin against mine
She pouted as I took my    hand out with a small folded piece of green paper
She seemed a bit    shocked by this, but not as much as when
Her mom called "ARE YOU GUYS STUDYING UP THERE
Every now and then, Marissa always seems to have this incredible urge to    model
9 out of ten times she did this she suddenly became 100 times more    beautiful for the span of 2 seconds
As the crash settled, it usually    dawned on me that she was really beautiful anyway
She gently motioned with her right hand to accompany the left's flourish-    revealing the dollar once more
Slowly she flipped it over and I watched    the dollar dive once more into her shirt
At the last second she flipped    it again and the modeling was complete
She casually handed the dollar to    me, probably quite aware of the effect she had on my mind
Us guys tend to really lose all thinking processes in the company of    someone like her
It's hard not to stare when looking at an angel
So what happens next, I find myself wondering
It's been so long since I    did any of this
Well, quite clearly, I'm torn
On the one hand, it turns    out I'm starving
I always have held back next to Marissa, trying (I    guess) to be some sort of perfect figure
I always tear at myself from the    inside too, and this hunger seemed to be the embodiment of all that
My stomach moaned and groaned and got very angry with me
If I had taken    my shirt off then, you would see a really big frowny face on it
It would    look gruff and harsh, with a slight roll of flab at the base for a mouth,    and two steely eyes from the faint lines of my abs
It would look a bit    like when you look at someone through a thin film or curtain
The nose was    the distinct dent of my belly button
It would have roared in its    unpleasant, complaining way, and cause quite the dreadful ruckus in my    belly
On the other hand, there was English
Now English is a very important    class to me
If I ever feel like being of any respect to myself in as a    writer, I have to start by actually caring
I need to take this class    seriously, unlike most of my other classes
Not only that, but I have a    bad history with essays
Oh well
The point is
that I needed to study for English, at any costs
But you know, none of these things were really first in my mind when the    question was posed: "Do you want to keep studying Chem
or what
Ew, not that, that's gross
I mean
I didn't think you thought that
of course not
Just ignore that one
But oh well
Sometimes, I really wonder what to do    with myself
I have really not the greatest habits inside my mind
Come to    think about it my outside habits are pretty bad too
Man, my lice are    killing me
Oh ok, I really have to pull it together
Here we go
Sometimes, the greatest things I do are complete accidents
In fact, this    happens often
We rip out the notes for English
Apparently, there's a    "good chance" that literary terms will make up the bulk of the test
The    first thing to come to mind is
We won't have like any
It gets    pretty annoying
Well, girls rule the world anyway, so there's no point in trying to change    anything when you could just go with the flow
Wait
why is that one hand    written
or, I thought I lost it, so I called you to tell me the terms
When you think about it
English is perfect
for meeting girls
See    for one, it's said that chicks dig poetry
Now I don't know about that,    because everyone I talk to isn't the mushy-gushy type on the outside, but    who knows
You'd think Marissa would enjoy lifting weights with such    dedication to
being a REALLY hot guy, but no
Plus, if I'm simple, it    can't be that hard for everyone else to do
Not only that, but in the STUDY of English, you have the two greatest    things ever- puns and comparisons
If all else fails, you can speak in an ENGLISH accent
No seriously, it    works like a charm, and you won't look the slightest bit stupid
Haha, I crack me up
When sitting side by side on a bed staring at the same piece of paper
filled with all sorts of fun literary terms, things get pretty
well,    fun
It's also quite saddening
Well, first and foremost to understand that there is no such thing as a    literary term that is TOO simple
for Marissa
this is going    to be a long night)
I love doing these
Not only do I get this incredible feeling of actually    being smart, but I have a fun time making up thousands of examples
Some    of them are quite
group intensive
Most of them are really fun too
Fun is the word of the page, if you haven't noticed
The Difference Between the People
AKA first, second and third person    forms
Well, it all started with Omniscient
Well, if this were the midterm for    Sunday school, then Marissa would get 100 bonus points for definition,    side story, and implications of the word
Ok, Omniscient is something that's like
all knowing
Think of crazy acid trip waves and hippie arm    motions
yeah
and this has what to do with English
The excited expression quickly vanishes, and so do    the crazy hand motions
it's hard to teach girls
As I'm soon to find out, it is, however, a lot more fun
See, it has to do with the persons
people
Well, anyway, you know, first person, second person
it's so hard to teach girls
So first person would be like, when the person"     "Uses `I'
like `I am holding Marissa's hand
We're suddenly holding hands
I pull away
It's just happening
Like `Marissa and Jeff were holding hands
The    two hands sit happily together, wrapped around each other
It feels a bit    awkward, but I don't want to change it
Maybe I just suck at holding    hands
That thought kind of troubles me, but by now I'm trying to sort out    Omniscient and Limited third person into some sort of sentence that makes    sense
the Omniscentadf and limidedkj
I remember that, one of them is like everything and the other
Marissa's pretty pissed
I cough on my hand, wipe it on my pants, and jokingly offer it back to    her
She takes it without even the slightest thought
I sort of roll my    eyes and stifle a laugh
Anyone looking on probably would have caught it,    and whacked me over the head for it, but for the time it was pretty random    in a strange sort of funny type dealio
thing
With a little smile, I shift my weight to my right
I suddenly become    quite aware of exactly where I am
Mostly this is because I suddenly find myself falling off her pillow and    into a conveniently placed gap between her bed and the wall
Whoopee, what    fun
Where exactly am I
Well, basically in a very dangerous place
Her room is    a cozy and inviting place for a guy like me
Everything is soft and safe,    things shine with interest and intrigue
The room glows with soothing    warmth and at the same time is full of power and knowledge
I seem to be    huddled into the most ironic corner of the room
I just stumbled into the    corner of Memory Lane and Social Studies Avenue
The wall I'm against has first and foremost a map
It's kind of sad that    she has it there
Apparently she once memorized every country and capitol    of both America's, bored out of her mind and with little to do but stare    at the map for hours on end
Social Studies, Geography, History
It's all    the same to me, and it's all boring, impossible, and unnecessary
What does this have to do with anything
How is it possible that Marissa    could stand for those things, and yet I find her an endless source of    fun
albeit impossible to reason with and truthfully unnecessary
I once talked with a few people about the factor of necessity in    relationships
Technically, very little is necessary
I don't need to be    friends with so-and-so, or I don't need to have them like me
But then    again, I don't need to be alive, and I don't need to be happy
It's all a    matter of what you mean by necessary
Not caring if I were dead or unhappy    would solve all of my problems
except then I'd be dead and unhappy
Memory lane
As I look beyond the map, I see a seemingly random assortment    of pictures on her wall
It's mostly just random moments, spread about on    the wall
I notice that not many of them involve me
in fact, I don't    see any
Oh gee
how ironic
I love it when life laughs in my face
As I lie there, trying to readjust myself so that the wall no longer digs    into my shoulder and the bed no longer pushes me into the wall, I start to    suddenly become entirely too conscience of Marissa looking onto me
Well,    not exactly
I have an intense feeling like I'm being watched, targeted by    her for like a hawk sights its prey
I sort of scramble about mentally and    physically, trying to get into a position advantageous to me
I have one amazing defensive flaw though
She has a reason to stare, and I    have no reason to run
In my attempt to get comfortable, I remember the paper
I suddenly have a    strange image of myself
I look shocked, scared
I almost look like a    stiff, paralyzed twig, my whole body perfectly straight and in line
I'm    tilted oddly sideways, towards a wall, and propped up to look down at my    toes
My wide eyes look down the length of my body and that brings more    fear and apprehension somehow
In my right hand, towards the wall, I carry    a sheet of white paper
On the other hand, a smooth young lady is lying relaxed next to me
Her    legs are bent naturally
Her whole body is just soft and smooth and curvy
She's snuggled up lovingly with this shocked, awkward boy
She comes the final inch or two closer and ever so gently kisses me
Everything freezes
At first I wonder why the world is suddenly so still,    why absolutely nothing is happening at all
It's like you fall off a    stair, and right after you go just the tiniest bit too far over the edge,    everything seems to just stop
And stupefied, you wonder what's going on,    why is everything just not right
Then it hits you
She kissed me
Why would she kiss me
How could she do this
With a sudden jolt everything springs into action, and that split second    that lasted forever is made up, as the earth seems to spin twice as fast    to balance everything out
As the world lurches back into motion, I feel    awkward just sitting there
I clear my throat and look up at the ceiling for a bit before picking up    the paper again and trying to continue on
I read off a term, and she    seems to use every ounce of femininity in communicating "um
Its getting harder and harder
Part of it is that I've been just    slipping and slipping all night, so now as I finally begin to just fall, I    already have momentum
She slides closer, and I slip a little more, tumbling down- mentally    taking the phrase "falling in love" too literally
I feel her breath on me    as she peeks at the answer
I turn the paper slowly, and she follows as if    attached by some invisible force
Every bit I turn it, brings her closer    and closer
We're playing off each other again, wearing the other down    until they can't resist any longer
Then we could be together, and    everything would be perfect
Rain clouds dump their heavy load inside my mind as she answers and pulls    away slightly
She sticks around as I ask the next one
Everything is repeating itself; she slides over me again, but this time I    call her out
The answer suddenly    lost its importance and I mused at the current events
Why does she feel    the need to cheat so much
Is she only trying to see the answer, or is she    purposefully pressing in on me for some sick pleasure
Did she just enjoy    watching me squirm and try to resist her, or did she actually want me
She really is the biggest cheat ever
I think she's one of the handful of    people that actually know how things work in my mind, and is completely    unafraid to use it against me
She knows that to get anything, all she has    to do is ask, with a subtle promise of later having some sort of reward
It looses the effect if something tangible is promised in a very    tic-for-tat manner
Marissa has the best way of only hinting at it, so I    don't feel guilty about letting myself be used, but it doesn't ruin the    magic of a reward
Whatever it is, she really abuses her power over me
That's probably why I found myself there in the first place
Even before    coming over I knew this would end up happening
But you know, in my    position, who could complain
Spending time in bed with a beautiful young    lady
Just kidding
Plus, I needed the skirt anyway
Its hard to ignore someone who you still have feelings for, when you're    lying next to them
Its even harder if they're flirting with you
It gets    more difficult still, if you are trying to quiz them on literary terms
It    sort of becomes physically impossible if they are also cheating
Something had to be done, so we launched into a little debate about pretty    much the most random things
Eventually we decided that A) the literary    terms "would" be on the test, B) we were both heavy debters, and cheating    should therefore be allowed, and C) well we'll just see about that later    (get it
C about that
Wow the plot here is really chunky
very random transitions
shouldn't    have been so lazy
Forgot too much
This whole business of debt happens a lot
This is basically what I was    thinking when I found myself sitting up again, looking for some "Black    Voices" notes to skim through
As I idly shuffled through her papers, I    reflected on this
Not only was it the dollar thing, and various random bets, but this idea I    came across one day- long ago when we were still together
Well, things happen
But more importantly things don't happen
So what    happens to all those little gaping gaps in what happens
Well, they have    to go somewhere
This is basically what I thought when on the subject of    kissing
If you don't already know this, I kind of made it a game to see if I could    make Marissa kiss me
Everyone knows both of us wanted it, but it was    always quite entertaining to play this game
This is probably the biggest    reason she broke up with me
For someone who likes games so much
she is    a really bad sore loser
She really ALWAYS lost this game
Well the point is, all those kisses that mysteriously disappeared
well    they had to come back sometime, didn't they
When bored during Social Studies, Marissa definitely took priority to    paying attention
And one day, I was sort of bored
and wondered what it    would be like if
well I'll just show you
We're in her basement
That awesome couch of hers
It's so comfy, and has    a million good memories
The floor right next to it does too     Haha
Anyways, the point is, that when denied kisses enough times, she'd    probably get PISSED
Who would've guessed
But instead of
being a jerk    and breaking up with me, things would probably be a lot more fun if she    decided to do something about it
She looked at me with her eyes
the ones she always makes when she wants    something, but won't tell me
Usually, I'd see her look at me like that in    the hall, and it fills me with an amazing desire to hold her, and make    everything all better
kiss me
ummmmmmmmmmmm- I thought
It sounded so awkward
What was I supposed    to do
I began to grin
To me it was suddenly a fun new adventure
Who    knew what would happen
Whatever it was, it was bound to be fun
She picked up on the game and snuggled closer
The words were suddenly harsh,    and part of me meant them
Marissa kept me going
I slipped back easily as she jokingly brought up    "yeah, you owe me so much
I guess I liked it,    because I found myself counting down from a completely random number
Boredom is Love's best friend I    guess
All of this just idly passes through mind, and I find what I'm looking    for
Black
Voices
She makes a grab for them, but    misses
You're going to rip them
With the papers temporarily uncontested, she tries to find an appropriate    safe zone for them
She turns away briefly to prevent me from taking    them
An idea springs to her head
She sits on them, and lays down
I sigh, look at her, and tell her she can't be serious
She was reclined with her feet to me
I could tour her body looking up    from there, past the legs, the butt, the belly and all the way up to her    hand that played with her headboard, ready to use it for leverage if    necessary
As I survey her body, I think of how easy it would be to just    lift her up and push her aside
For one, MIGHT let me see them
is a rather delicate thing with    Marissa
Its really a 10% chance to see them
For two, what was I thinking
Oh right
it's all too easy
I was just    thinking how easy it would be to just pick her up
I'm way stronger than    her, so it'd be a piece of cake
For the moment, it would be a lot more fun to just play with her a bit    more
What did she THINK I was thinking
But really I was    just figuring out if I could lift her up and steal some papers from under    her butt
I guess, after thinking about what I was thinking before she    asked what I was thinking, is that I was thinking about the debt thing
I    think
It was wayyyyyy before the thinking question though
I could just push    you aside
I knew she thought I    had something dirty going through my mind
A long time ago, Marissa was what I lived on
She was a highly addictive    drug that supplied an endless high as long as she was by my side
Just    holding her hand as I walked down the hall gave me an electric thrill
But    that was a long time ago
I was clean for at least a month
I was out of    her grasp now
Well
until I took a hit
With just a tiny bit of her    influence rampaging about in my body, I was hooked again
I suddenly felt    the urge of addition
I suddenly found myself sitting on top of her in a    very sexually suggestive way
If her mom caught me
lets just say she'd    be in a hell of a lot of trouble
For a brief second, I thought of just    taking advantage of her
after all I was stronger, and in an interesting    position
It would be so easy to just lean forward and kiss her
give in    to her strong will
I felt a physical pull toward her lips
With this feeling, I realized what    was happening
I immediately snapped out of her psychological grip and    pulled myself together
Well, yeah
last night when you gave me permission to be lazy
this    happened
Haha
Long story short
hopefully only one page short, but no guarantees on    that one
Ok so a long time ago, all the stuff above happened
except for that one    page I put in SPECIAL for Jamie
That didn't happen
The point of all this    is that I REALIZE that on the outside it was basically like I hated you
It's because I wanted to
It was the only thing protecting me from you
That and the bet
Well, giving up seems to be my thing lately, so I    obviously gave up on resisting you
I think that alcoholic beverages are    in order for my welcome back ceremony
Or maybe just hip music and lots of    fun dirty dancing
like the welcome back dance
Either way, it should be    fun
I mean you're involved
Anyway
because it sort of looked like I hated you, but actually really    wanted to be with you, all that excess energy had to go somewhere
And it    came here
So this was my vent for all those feelings
I came home from    you house, wrote four pages, and went to bed
Then
left it to sort of    rot until two weeks before your birthday
Starting 2 weeks before your birthday, I started devoting a lot of time to    this
It was pretty much forced sleep deprivation
I worked late at night    when nobody would see me
Of course I was kind of tired at the time, but    it was addicting
I couldn't stop myself
I tried to take a break from it    one time
and discovered that I would wake up somewhere between 1 and 2,    the time that I would usually finish, and want to turn on my computer and    start it up again
I gave drafts to Abby and Jamie
The idea was to have them edit it
but    really I just wanted someone to know
See
It takes two to fill your    place
Haha
in the place of him is two    different anchors
why did he have to smoke so much and die
Late at    night I guess I get bored pretty fast
It starts off kind of
Off
I mean
that's how I was at the time
Couldn't figure out what was what inside my mind
You do this to me a lot
Can't think quite right after I see you
Get all zoney and stuff
Lots of    stuff is just jumbled up
Well, anyway, this one week addiction continued to the beginning of the    next week too, leading up to your birthday that Saturday
Then
Abby and    Jamie both agreed that it would be a horrible idea to give it to you as a    gift
And so
I fell back on other plans
By that time I was pretty much getting tired of the whole project
I'm not    a novelist
it doesn't work so well for me
Long stories are hard
I    think you'll notice a lot of random jerks
That's me getting tired, losing    my memory, getting bored, or starting up fresh for a new night
It gets    more and more obvious, and the writing gets more and more
bad
Some time after all this, I think during HSPAs, I started up again    briefly, turning up about 3-4 pages over like 3 days
It was pretty bad
So, now that the timing is actually good ("you didn't appreciate being at    my house last time"- well sometimes I just try so hard not to show it
except that X-BOX
Much more fun than Chem ;-) haha) I decided that its    not going to be easy at ALL to finish this up
So I called
I <3 u
thx    4 letting me b lay-z
Work is hard
But Hard is not always work
That    could be dirty
COULD be
It's a beautiful world we live in, but riddled with stupid petty problems,    and full of hate and so it seems doing anything to promote that beauty is    futile
The world is physically beautiful, it came up once while discussing this    that "there's not a single person I see over there that isn't good    looking
Full of differences, but full of just about anything worth    longing for
Look outside your window, or just think for a moment, what lies out there
Trees
Grass
Hills
The sun
Yes, but what else
Just that
Or is there beauty in the quiet winds, blowing, gently caressing the every    leaf, so the hill dances in a beautiful symphony
The conductor and the    instrument- wind dances to its own accompaniment, its vocals rising or    falling with the gusts, painting a serene, invisible picture with the    brushes of grass
the sun adding its own dazzling beauty, so pure and rich    it could only be compared to the deep dark eye of a lover, so limitless,    so perfect you feel unworthy to raise your own gaze to it and bask in that    infinite power
To feel the soft lenses wrap around you and fill you with    warmth
That safety and serenity of quiet solitude that could only be    disturbed by the ever changing landscape around you, all unheeded while    grasped in the fleecy blanket of timeless silk
And what kind of beautiful place wouldn't have that
Those feelings of justified security in something so intangible some spend    entire lives seeking it, yet so solid that the volumes of ideas on it    could take an entire lifetime to view, and yet only barely scratch the    surface
Such a mysterious force that it causes the impossible quite    regularly, and is doubted to be ever fully explained
Something quite so simple as well, that it only takes four letters to    explain at all
Love     It's a big world we live in, full of the impossible, the mysteries, and    most of all, beauty of it all
Almost like heaven     When I was watching that movie
I felt so
connected
I felt like I was reaching for something, struggling to find someone to    hold on to
It might just be force of habit, but watching that movie made me suddenly    realized that I wanted Marissa
Why is it that I have to be such a pain in the ass to her
Right as she's moving on, going out with Jared, do I suddenly want her    back
During the English presentations, she was just
there
I wanted to    snuggle in with her
hold her
No, it was before that
It was during the chem lab, when I wanted to    squeeze her, give her a hug
Before that even
At her locker
No, no, it was before this
It was her and those damn legs of hers
She    started it
Days before that
no, weeks
months     I guess I never really stopped caring about her
I guess it was just a bit    fuzzy for a little while
Whenever Jamie or Abby would say "you love her don't you
But how do you explain it, when every day I seem to want her again
Maybe I was just concentrating on how much I hate her because we aren't    together
I cant help myself
I think I've made a decision, but its not done yet
I think I have to tell her, and tell myself, that I'm officially all out
All this time, I've been half in, half out
Like I still wanted to be in, but I was being pushed out the door
Well, wouldn't life be simple, if I were finally on the outside
Wouldn't it be so much easier, if every time I wanted to hold her in my    arms, it would just be a fantasy, and not a reality I COULD have
Everything would be easier, if I were on the outside, and knew for sure    that that's where I stood, that I couldn't just come barging in because I    was no longer that close
I might have to start ringing her door bell     Theres a lot to prepare
The story, the letter, the CD
But right now, I wish I knew what would be right
I wish I hadn't made that stupid bet to myself
Learning a bit of self restraint is never that bad
Well she started it
I don't know what to do
I'm only evil when bored
10/3/09     Jeffrey     heyyyy you

hah     3:48pmJeffrey     :( damn, me neither     3:48pmElise     hahah     it sucks
but you (meaning people in general) make do     3:50pmJeffrey     mmmhmmm     well     how soon can i expect a "Elise Fengler is now listed as In a    Relationship"
3:51pmElise     hahah i dont know

3:54pmJeffrey     (boredom+lack of girlfriend=me being evil for kicks)     there is a high positive correlation between how bored i am and how evil i    can be     3:55pmElise     hahah oh man
Mutually exclusive     Today (2/7/07), I was trying to get through my Holocaust and Genocide    "Genocide" packet
when I found myself drifting off to that land between    reality and the dream world
It happens a lot when my assignments involve    huge amounts of reading and or annotating (I hear Mrs
Olszyk recently    coined the term "scannotate" for this sort of thing
not making any    judgments of course, possibly because that woman completely scares the    bajezus out of me)
Recently there's been a lot of stuff happening    involving god and all that
LA usually deals pretty heavily on it because    a lot of the writers want people to think about "the essential human    nature" as Mr
O'Brien says
HGS (Holocaust & Genocide Studies) obviously    brings up the same sort of thing
Mr
Porter had a thing for good vs
evil    (and diet coke
And it's been spreading lately to science
Science and    math used to be the safe haven for atheism
Math and science are based    completely off physical laws and evidence, but a few theories are floating    around there that could be (the evidence is all there, or else they    wouldn't be theories), but of course could be wrong
For example, right now, there COULD BE a planet exactly the same as Earth,    but on exactly the opposite side of the sun
And we would be completely    oblivious to any of it
All the current physics laws we have about    gravitation say that if it were the same radius away, it could be there    and we wouldn't see a speck of it
ever
If the mass of it were small    enough, we would have the same elliptical path around the sun we do now
The only problems I see with this problem is A) I think by now we could    just shoot off a little probe to take pictures and make sure there's    nothing there, and B) wont the other planets screw with it and make it    eventually just off enough so that we can see it if we get someone to take    a long hard look at the sun
that thing's    bright
Mr
Daher, you let us down
I was going to the place where scientists argue with religious people
It's not abortion or stem cells
though I still don't see why people    cant just do them both
Its "intelligent design
Basically, things today are just SO complex that pure chance couldn't have    produced them
The first time I heard of it, I said "that's the stupidest thing I've ever    heard
Only idiots would believe that
Basically, the oversimplified version of their    conversation was "that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard
Only idiots    would believe that
they just have a different view
And then I heard of this book "The Case for A Creator
so I'll probably end up reading    this book to find out for myself) is that some guy went out to try to tell    all "THOSE" idiots that believe in Intelligent Design that they're being    foolish and that Biology is the right way
And then he discovered that it    wasn't just some hick theory, but it had a lot of good hard evidence    behind it, so published a sort of "how we know god exists, and `THOSE'    people aren't actually idiots
they just have a different theory
On    the news (showing us a supposedly "impartial and completely factual" view)    they have pieces on how the permafrost is melting away, and that all our    glaciers are kind of dying, and the ice in the artic and in Greenland is    going away too
and that all the polar bears are on their way to    extinction, and that for SOME reason (usually they present the theory of    global warming, but sometimes they don't) we're having record numbers of    tropical storms (including hurricanes and tsunami's)
So
that's the bit I have, so what I always say is "everybody knows the    world is getting warmer, but nobody knows for sure what's causing it
Even if I didn't watch the inconvienient truth    movie and presentation (that said that all the good scientists are showing    us the correlation between CO2 and temperature-specifically don't say    "causation" because there's no way to prove that), I would take one look    at the oil company's utterly ridiculous defense for CO2 and think to    myself "well, now I KNOW it's CO2's fault
It just bugs me
When I was in the in-between land, I got thinking on a conversation with a    super-Christian to show him that he was sort of just being a bastard
I thought to myself "there has to be a lot of evidence for something for    everyone to believe it
It just wouldn't last more than 10 year or so if    there weren't
Somebody would have noticed
If nothing else, I trust that    somebody checked all the facts on evolution
You couldn't trick this many    people for this long
People are finally waking    up to what a big hoax all that evolution business was
Its just entirely    ridiculous to be able to say that that's what happened for sure
How do you know he's not just a bigger hoax
Are you trying to tell me that God definitely exists
You obviously    believe he does, you believe he created everything
But what about the    rest of us
the ones without faith
Are we supposed to believe without a    speck of evidence in something that's completely illogical
In the Bible
how do you know the bible is God's word
What if Moses screwed up
What if the new testament is just a fairy tale    that an ancient fiction writer drew up, and the Jews were tricked into    believing it was part of the bible
What if Christ was just a man, and    anything more was dreamed up by someone else
Who fooled more people
Him: "
Obviously    Christianity must have SOMETHING in it that draws such a huge number of    believers
Biology and Evolution have something in it that brings a ton of    people to believe it too
Both of them work
And, if only two of every animal    was saved on the ark, then doesn't that mean that evolution exists anyway,    because we clearly have a lot more than one species of everything
And scientific measurements    could be wrong
Did you ever hear about those mice    that live in the West, and they have subspecies that go all nutso
not really
There's three groups
A, B, and C
A's on the top, b in the middle, and C down south
where the populations    meet, they will interbreed a little, but they won't really migrate
so A and C are different species, but    how do you explain B existing
I WIN
A
B
C
all of the above
Me: "sigh
Anyways, I think that's enough of that
Gotta get back to scannotating

Eastern Daylight Time |    +----------------------------------------------------------+     You'd better come to wrobo run
it might kill you, but kelsey wants to walk it
and you two are BEST    buddies     and we got Hunter to admit he hates her voice too     it was pretty great     is exact phrase was "i have NIGHTMARES about that voice"     (we were talking about how he was ordered to pick up her sweatshirt she    just left somewhere on the course
but we dont know where it is or what    it looks like, but we all know there's a hefty price to pay if we dont get    it)           marissa, i'm too lazy to write
and sasha and i are just friends, dont worry (not that you SHOULD    considering my luck with girls
she is a pretty good runner, you    might need to worry about that     I recruited her
sort of     kind of
hopefully     but who really knows     she's not a very cuddly person, though she really looks it     she was feeling bad/grouchy
and sad too     so i gave her a hug     and she said quite angrily "Ok
who is hugging me
watch out
Jeffrey     it was scary     2:30pmEssie     lmao     how was it scary
2:30pmJeffrey     everything followed in a logical progression leading me to a place i don't    want to go     2:31pmEssie     ohh     2:31pmJeffrey     on the plus side, a lot of things make sense     2:31pmEssie     really     like what
2:32pmJeffrey     just things     2:32pmEssie     thats good :)     2:32pmJeffrey     hmmm, but there were a few problems tho too
2:32pmEssie     like
2:32pmJeffrey     the preacher was listing a bunch of types of people     that are bad, but don't want to think about the consequences     and one of them was drag queens     Why are drag queens doing something wrong
generally, drag queens are doing things wrong     but if they were just cross dressingn     then that's fine, isnt it
but drag queens also have a tendancy to drink/smoke/prostitute     2:34pmEssie     see     the thing is     you know, god made us the way we are     and we have to embrace who and what we are as people     2:34pmJeffrey     and if we like dressing in girls clothing
2:34pmEssie     bcos God knows us the best, and he has an ultimate plan for us     2:35pmJeffrey     they're embracing that they're kinda fucked up     2:35pmEssie     um
i honestly dont know how to answer it     but ill do some reading and ill give you an answer to that     2:35pmJeffrey     but do you think it's evil to cross dress     or wrong
Essie     honestly, i havent really thought about that     Jeffrey     ok     the other thing that bothers me     is that he said that "christianity is the only religion that's under    attack in such a vicious manner"     and he attributed it to "because we're the only ones right, and other    people are afraid of that"     basically     but
what about jews in ww2
that
a pretty vicious manner     2:38pmEssie     hes talking about like present day     2:38pmJeffrey     and
lots of people in america hate muslims     that's not as vicious, but still pretty bad     2:38pmEssie     yea i understand that, but as christians we see that we are always under    attack     2:39pmJeffrey     yeah, well, not as bad as other people     2:39pmEssie     the reason we hate muslims is bcos of that 911 thing and everything     thats bcos for us, its more under the radar     and its just throughout, like so many times missionaries are attacked     they're killed     he wasnt saying that christians are whte only ones getting attacked     2:40pmJeffrey     because they're considered an attack on the religion/customs that are    already present     2:40pmEssie     its just that we do get attackekd the most     2:41pmJeffrey     i follow the "don't put your hand out if you don't want to get bitten"    policy
missionaries in hostile areas
are begging to be attacked     just like
the US pulls out the embassies in times of war
christians    shouldn't put missions in places like sudan     because they will be attacked     2:43pmEssie     hey sorry     oh my bad i just signed off so yea sorry     2:43pmJeffrey     ok     2:43pmEssie     i understand that its dangerous in those places     but its when countries are in such hostile states and in such turmoil that    they need the most help     2:44pmJeffrey     yeah, but then don't complain that they're getting attacked     2:44pmEssie     well its truth     im not complaining     im just stating facts     2:45pmJeffrey     they're getting attacked because they're foreign, not because they're    christian     2:45pmEssie     not necessarily     2:45pmJeffrey     ok     give a counterexample     2:45pmEssie     in korea, korean missinoaries get attacked     how are we foreign
2:46pmJeffrey     what's the major religion in korea
2:46pmEssie     in china, people who are christians cant worship openly     2:46pmJeffrey     because they're not a christian nation     they're not the "norm"     foriegn     2:49pmEssie     aigihts yo we will continue this later     but i gotta go meet up with a friend     but yea, we will talk :)     2:50pmJeffrey     ok

dont kill yourself
God In Sleep     4/30/09     When talking with Avi about how hard it is to get up early and get all    your work done, I mentioned that for me, it's pretty easy, because Luke    tends to have early classes, so I'll set my alarm to about the time that    he wakes up, and even if I oversleep, I'll still wake up when he comes    back from a shower, and his physical presence makes me more apt to get out    of bed
But these are special, unusual circumstances
My question is (one that's probably been discussed for ages and ages): Are    these chance circumstances that aid me proof (or at least evidence) of    some sort of higher power, playing with the odds of random occurrences, or    do we simply look to make the best of the situations given to us, and    largely ignore when things are not ideal
For example, it's simply hard for Avi to force himself to get up and go to    class
So for him, the norm is to have a difficult time, and there's just    nothing to do about it
But I have special circumstances that work out    well for me, so my comparative baseline is really high, and it seems kind    of like he just has it bad
So, I guess what I'm trying to say, but still can't find the words for,    is: are these random things good because they're intended to be good, and    someone's manipulating chance, or are they truly random, and I take    advantage of them, if I want
It would be an inconvenient situation if I just wanted to sleep in    everyday
But that's what naps are for (under my current philosophy, which    takes full advantage of my unique circumstances
Sometimes, I try
I really do
But the thing is, I don't really know how    to most of the time
Well
where did this start
Lets say it started    with Rosie
Rosie was just someone I knew
She was pretty cool
And after Marissa left    this vast empty hole in me, Rosie suddenly seemed available
Marissa    sometimes asks what I saw in her
It was probably just because her luggage    fit mine
Please, please, PLEASE, don't make the reference to "my humps"    that I can see coming
I meant that she and I have generally the same    background
The other way is gross and involves butts for those of you who    don't know
Well, after hanging out with her for a while, I eventually found my way    into her house
Dave, the only "adult" there picked me up from my house,    took me over
and proceeded to watch both of us like a hawk
I didn't    quite plan on that happening
I was mostly thinking that it would be me    and Rosie hanging out, sitting together, and maybe a little bit more if    things
went well
But Dave apparently would have none of it
And so 2    and 2/2 movies later, I went home and gave Rosie a good bye hug and "too    bad Dave was watching us
I so    wanted to be with Marissa, but Rosie was rising pretty quick too
But
Marissa always has been and always will be Marissa, and that means    something to me
To me, it meant a self imposed ban on "any sort of sex-related anything
for 6 months
Even though we weren't really    going out
we're not any more
But she's no    idiot
She probably saw Marissa and said "this one's hopeless" to    herself and let me do whatever the hell stupid thing I wanted
10 minutes    after I told her she suddenly decided that it was no longer cool and got    all pissed
The next week she saw me and Marissa holding hands, even though I    persistently walked with Rosie, just like for the brief time that we were    together
Then she called me a stalker, I cut my hair off, and she didn't    talk to me again (she promised that if I cut my hair she wouldn't talk to    me
but I think it was the stalker thing
On    half-assed days we pretend not to see each other in the halls, and on bad    days I get a glare instead of a wave
What is the point of this excessively long story
I don't know how to    solve my problems sometimes
Well let's see
I get dumped
so what do    I do
I
behave like a bastard and get with Rosie
just to dump her    randomly for a shitty reason when she sees exactly what's going on
Suddenly her not talking to me makes a lot more sense, doesn't it
Then
the damn ban sort of makes not being with Marissa a holy war
I    lost
now I have no morals
And
being caught up in all that    ideological quagmire for like 3 months A) made our feelings for each other    get all wimpy and saggy, and B) well, A's important enough
So
in sort, I REALLY didn't have a clue
I don't know how to freaking    try
And
for another thing, I was never really the greatest at trying when I    was with Marissa, I mean the whole
yeahhhhhhhhh
thing
But then, for a little while, I had my act together
I was focused, I    worked hard, I knew what I was doing
I was doing my best
But
As it    turns out
a really long, vaguely disturbing, 20 page story is
not    the greatest sweet 16 gift
so says Abby and Jamie
So
When I finally    tried my best, gave it my all, I was barking up the wrong tree, doing all    the wrong things, and the worst part is, I got all demoralized and stuff    after I heard that it was a bad plan
so never finished
She saw what I    had eventually, but I gave her a crap ending to wrap up the story
Sometimes, I cheat
We're not talking about Monopoly here
we're playing    for keeps
This is for real
This is life or death
This is high school    dating
This is some serious shit
Well, during one certain band trip, there were some trippy girls (ahaa    pun
Well
she was sitting on me
and I kind of wanted her off
and kind of wanted to see how much of a slut she was
so I invited    myself to her body
At first it was kind of to get her off
but she let    me in pretty deep before she stopped me
so I kept going, see what    happens
So basically, she refused to get off
The idea was to get her off
it    wasn't working
But
if at first you don't succeed (at Pissing someone    off by feeling them up when you're not
close), try, try again
Soon
she was kind of enjoying it
and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't    having a good time
So
I started getting worried that I'd actually be    cheating
That means
ACTUALLY doing something
So, I thought the best    medicine would be to do something outrageous
I started trying to take off    her pants
and shirt
Well, that didn't go so well, but she did    EVENTUALLY get off
Fucking whore
JK
It was a fun time
But
the point is
I was kind of cheating on Marissa
because my    idea to get her off (a good thing) was pretty bad
I think it would be best if from now on I followed Nick Gabinet's wise,    yet sarcastic advice
I tried to clean myself up
I told Marissa the
news
in    a way that was sure to provoke reaction
It was like this
First tell    other people, so she hears it through the grape vine, then saying it in a    way that was excited for having done it, so she's pissed, and while she's    pissed about it, give your least convincing act of "it was nothing, and it    wont happen again
I mean
you were practically killed the last    time it happened
But no, she just sighed
Maybe it's because I was actually trying to get    away with it
but I'm not entirely sure I'm that good
Make her out to be the bad guy stylistically-I mean    what's wrong with her
not hating me-, so everyone sees it the way it    is
and put the phrase "I'm that good" so its like "wow jeff, she loves    you
and ur an ass")     Oh btw, I have succeeded in making things as awkward as possible between    me and Kristin, so I don't think this will be a problem during the next    band trip
I tried very little at this, but it worked real well
another    fine example of me not knowing how to try is that the only thing I did    right was both A) an accident, and B) based on destroying things
I mean    seriously
And Kelly
That's a problem
Well, Somewhere in all this, I got in the    habit of flirting with Kelly every day during Spanish for as long as    possible
This is probably because she was in our foursome in the    beginning of the year, and now that we were all separated, she was the    only one I knew
So I talked with her, we got kind of close, and I flirted    non-stop
Soon we enjoyed "hand-sex" (she's horrible
I think it's just that her    hands are kind of masculine and meaty
she went w/ her family, I stopped by    during intermission
Oh, btw, we have lunch together, so that's something too
Her mom, I    thought, is a REALLY good sandwich maker
But it turns out, they look    better than they taste
Oh well
But I did meet her at the play and for a    bit we talked about this sandwichmaker
and how she doesn't look the    role
Well, there was also her brother's play which I didn't go to
And that leads us nicely to
when I told her about my little doohickey    with nothing related to sex
for a while
That's where the phrase "hand    sex" came from
its an inside joke from our lunch table
And soon
I broke the oath and said basically "oh yeah Kelly, I'm with    Marissa now
and its not my fault
happened
so that's that
But wait
flirting has a hard time stopping itself
so that went on    for a while
And soon
catalyzed by being invited to a Yankees game on Sunday, April    23, 2006, I kind of had to stop flirting with her
So
the only thing I could think of to do
is stop talking to her
And    in Spanish class, to not talk is to be bored
and sleep
And to let Cole    win
what a fellow
More on this later
when Marissa found out about this randomness, things went bad
then good
then she tested me
and I passed
but just barely
See, instead of calling her in the morning
I was too lazy until like    11
Then I took care of a few things, and decided to call her during    lunch
But then I decided to spare her the
lunch eating over the phone,    and my parents left right after I finished lunch
So I couldn't really    ask them if she could come over or anything
And then
HW, followed by    dinner plans, where I sort of gave up on the idea of getting together with    her, and then it turns out we weren't going anywhere
but I had to eat    dinner anyway
Then I called
but it was too late
And
it could have all been    solved
if I had just called earlier
Also
I would have avoided my    own massive retardation of playing her into a story about me and Kelly    hooking up
Then Mrs
Greco didn't want me to come over
But yeah
that didn't work out so well
scratch one plan)
And also
with that stupid story went another fun plan I had
Which shows that remembering your plan is a big problem of mine
I try so    hard to remember, but remembering is something so hard to remember
And being nice
is something I always try to tell myself to do
But I    fail at it so much
In fact, I had forgotten I was supposed to be doing it    until Marissa said "you know, you're so mean, I don't even know why I    bother trying anymore
And    when I try, it usually doesn't turn out right
And if it could work, I've    screwed up
But
I'm going to keep trying to try

like I wanted to go dancing- just so fun and awesome like
Please please me- this is what you ALWAYS said to me
and it's true
Just replace "girl" with "boy"
Naturally, my response is "don't worry, about a thing
Bulimic- you break up with me
I'm a waste of your time
yay for the    Used
so insane, so angry, and so right
This is the more raw version of    the song- from the CD Rosie bought me for Christmas- seems sort of harsh    and hastily done
just like you breaking up with me
What a coincidence
Let's end it on this- the song I was TRYING to tell you about when you    were dumping me
The disc this came from was kind of scratched up and    old
and broken

All these things that I've done
this is me trying to move on, but I    kind of need you
Underneath it all: finally, you start to pull back to me, but you have to    ask
are you just playing
I'm wish it were easier for me to tell
Do you love me
that'd be cool Oh man, could you see backflips going    on
Anyway, it's what we were talking about in your room
it doesn't
I should learn to kiss too while I'm at it ;)     Honestly- where I am now

Information Decay
5/3/09     Owen: "Ok, now you're just using physics terms to talk about nothing
GRRR
It's really cool
And it makes sense
I swear
Owen came to my room last night to talk about stuff
And one of the things    was about girl advice
His issue was: if a girl feels your shirt (asking    "what kind of material is this"), is she flirting with you, or at least    interested
He came to me, although, clearly, I'm not the best one to be    talking to about these things
Technically, this is not true: I'm a great candidate for all the reasons    that he implicitly showed when he came to me
For one, I'm comfortable    talking to him about these things, and him with me
Secondly, I have at    least slightly more experience than him
Thirdly, we have similar    behaviors or mindsets, or at least generalized appeal to the opposite sex,    so many variables are at least reasonably controlled, and we can eliminate    at least SOME variables that would lead to bad advice
Imagine if he got help from a major player that gets girls all the time,    mostly due to good looks, and general charm
These things would be utterly    foreign to him, and things that work perfectly for super-pimp would never    in a million years work for Owen
The problem is: I'm not THAT much better at these things than he is, so    analysis is pretty limited
My answer was: no, probably not, but if you swoon over the shirt touching,    then they'll know YOU'RE interested
Also, if you swoon inappropriately,    like I do, awkward, but funny (and hopefully kinda cute) things happen
At    the very least life is a little more interesting
Well, the solution to him coming to me, but me not getting the greatest    advice, is that I could simply ask the next person up the chain for their    advice on the same thing
Hopefully that's a little better
And if not,    they'll ask the next person up, and so on and so forth
That would certainly be interesting
But also subject to a lot of the    "telephone effect", or secondhand news type of thing
Owen said "I wish you could do radioactive sourcing on information"
Or
something
damn
Hmmmm
if it's giving off radiation, that means it's decaying, right
does that mean that the older information is, the less useful it is
Because that would make sense
so    what
So
what do you think the half life of information is
Wait, wait, wait, wait
What about things that stack on top of each    other
Like math
When you learn addition, it's pretty important
But then you learn    multiplication, which is just repeated addition
And then you learn    powers, which are repeated multiplication
And then when you hit calculus,    it's really the addition of infinitely small slices, so in essence,    addition is only more and MORE important as time goes on
But
does it still decay
When you know calculus, doing addition is no    big deal
but that may be because you have a large amount of addition    within your body, so the change in concentration is very small
Either that
Or information simply breaks down into smaller subunits
For example, after a multiplication undergoes decay of one half-life,    you're left with
a multiplication, and like 2 additions
And maybe some    other junk that floats around
So
say you learn addition, and then you learn multiplication
You'll have 1
an addition plus one multiplication if it takes you 1    half-life to learn the next level (but you gain an extra addition because    you're practicing it)
Also, you'll have half an addition (by mass) worth    of crap made
And then while you're learning powers, you'll have 2
75    addition, 1
5 multiplications, and one powers
And also 1
25 additions of    junk mass, and whatever the breakdown of multiplications creates of junk
And so on and so forth
And so, addition DOES become increasingly important as you learn higher    level math, as long as the higher level math breaks down into components    that eventually lead to addition
And all that extra junk
Probably goes to the internet
This is when Owen said
Owen: "Ok, now you're just using physics terms to talk about nothing
Elise     riiiightt     9:22pmJeffrey     no
seriously     9:22pmElise     well you do eventually ha     9:23pmJeffrey     all i need is enough for gas

i feel like then i would hate everything     9:24pmElise     hahaha true     so where should we go tomorrow
9:24pmJeffrey     hmmmmmmmmmmmm     anywhere but bk     miss leader     9:24pmElise     hah aggreed     haha     well we could go to p bagel
or pizza

9:26pmJeffrey     sure     but, to be honest
it sounds like you're trying to wiggle out of being the leader     9:26pmElise     im not trying to
its just what happens
9:26pmJeffrey     (giggle giggle giggle)     9:26pmElise     hahaha     9:28pmElise     so whats up
whats on your mind
ha     9:28pmJeffrey     i'm listening to a very deep song     9:28pmElise     nice
what song
9:29pmJeffrey     it is called "there are some remedies worse than the disease"     by "This will destroy you"     9:29pmElise     wow
intense
9:29pmJeffrey     yes
it also sounds intense     if you would like, i can email it to you     9:30pmElise     it ok i can look it up
haha one sec
whoa thats pretty interesting     9:31pmJeffrey     these types of songs
pretty much nobody likes     it's usually just me     9:31pmElise     that ok though
9:32pmJeffrey     elise
i think we need to talk about something
but
i'm kind of scared     9:33pmElise     yes     its ok i think we should talk about something as well
9:33pmJeffrey     geez, now i'm realllly scared     9:33pmElise     dont be scared     9:33pmJeffrey     ok, well, i guess since i brought it up     i'll go first
9:34pmElise     ok
9:34pmJeffrey     so, last night     i was hanging out with one of my closest friends     who i basically tell everything to     and he asked me a funny question     "is it ok for me to tell people that you're with Elise
I mean, we're actually together now, so i'm not just using her or    anything
I'm happy about this
So yes, you should tell people, if you    want
9:36pmJeffrey     yeah
9:36pmElise     wow
9:38pmElise     cause i know this might sound reallllly bad
but sometimes i feel/felt    that you were just into this for like the physical stuff
and it kept    making me rethink everything
and what happened the last time we were    together
it made me think that i might not be ready for a    relationship
but i love hanging out with you
and so now im like torn    between feelings
and with being really busy and everything i havent had a time to actually    sit down and try to sort them out     9:38pmJeffrey     yeah     i kind of guessed     because, later on in my talk w/ him     i sort of came to the conclusion     that, over spring break, i was definately using you     9:39pmElise     yea i sorta figured
9:39pmJeffrey     well, didn't mean to be
9:40pmElise     but like i said
i love hanging out with you
i just feel like when we try    to do like more
it gets iffy
like i dont know
im so torn
9:41pmJeffrey     yeah
basically: "yeah" sums up all my feelings towards this     9:42pmElise     i agree
i keep finding myself saying that too     i still think we should hang tomorrow
and no matter what happens
i    really hope we can stay (as you like to call it)
close personal friends
9:43pmJeffrey     definately yes     geezzzz     ok     well     one more thing     9:43pmElise     yea shoot
9:44pmJeffrey     ok     first     i am not going to break up w/ you right now     but this next question might seem like it     so don't flip out
9:44pmElise     haha     ok     9:44pmJeffrey     ok so, do you ever feel like "hey
this is a good time to leave     especially     in a conversation     and ESPECIALLY, on the phone     9:45pmElise     like you think the conversation is going nowhere
so you think you should    end it
9:45pmJeffrey     no     more like, it just feels like it's time     9:45pmElise     umm
yea i guess
sometimes     9:45pmJeffrey     o     ok     well,     9:45pmElise     why
hah     9:45pmJeffrey     that's how i feel on the phone     allll the time     except for when i still have an important mission
9:46pmElise     ohh i see     9:46pmJeffrey     like "what time are we meeting
Ok bye"     9:46pmElise     hah of corse
9:46pmJeffrey     is basically how i feel on the phone     9:46pmElise     hah interesting
so was that the question that i wasnt supposed to flip out on
or is    there another
cause i wouldnt/couldnt flip out on that question     hah     9:47pmJeffrey     oh     "do you ever feel like "hey
this is a good time to leave" "     seemed like it was leading to a breakup     when i first wrote it     9:47pmElise     ohhh haha     so tomorrow do you think we should discuss "us" more
or what
hah     9:51pmJeffrey     well
you have all of tonight     and tomorrow morning to think about it
but don't think TOO hard     9:51pmElise     haha true
well right now i feel like we should talk about at least some of it    tomorrow
but ill see what seems good as the day goes on tomorrow
did we totally skip what you were going to say
or was it similar     9:53pmElise     like when i said i think we should should talk about something too
and    you were like im really scared
9:53pmJeffrey     yeah
that one     9:54pmElise     it was similar
it was the same general topic     9:54pmJeffrey     ok     so
we're pretty much kind of settled     ish     basically     geezzz     well, actually     I'M settled     9:55pmElise     oh really
ha     9:55pmJeffrey     yes
9:55pmElise     wait
so what are you settled on     ha     9:55pmJeffrey     i've become very comfortable with whatever position i'm currently in     in my opinion, I am not using you, and we are in a real relationship, and    things are going to work out fine
if this is totally wrong
that's not good     but, for right now, that's exactly where i am     9:58pmJeffrey     geez, ur taking a long time to say nothing
9:58pmElise     hah no im gonna say something
dont hate me for it though
ha     9:59pmJeffrey     oh     i won't hate     please     go on     9:59pmElise     im glad were in a real relationship and youre not using me
hah
its just    that i dont know if im ready for it yet
or that i need someone my own    age
i dont even know
im so confused/torn
im not saying it want to end    anything like now
i think we should talk about it tomorrow
is that ok

AP Lit, You fail me again
NO
That's not what The Hollow Men is about at all
What's wrong with you
Can't you SEE
You're completely misinterpreting it
I see what you're saying, and it makes sense
But you're barking up the    wrong tree
Can't you see
This isn't a poem about that at all
Death's OTHER KINGDOM
Don't you get it
It's HERE
This isn't about heaven and hell
Those are Both death's    Kingdom
But this is Death's Other kingdom
This is a poem about how empty and hollow WE are
It's about how the world has forgotten how to live
Sure, Mr
Seltzer, you touched on it when everyone else had their turn
And Emily made the perfect parallel to the lost generation
But Why didn't you stop everyone and say "you're all wrong"
It's obvious    that the whole poem is telling us how completely empty everyone has    become
How We're all just mindless puppets
It's about how
Just how full of SHIT we are
Don't you see
Nothing we do really matters
That's what it means when it compares our    voices to the dirty background noises of mice and wind
We're so far gone    that we can't even comprehend how empty we are
THIS WORLD is the shadow
It has no substance left in it
It's a two dimensional fake of what real    life is
THAT's what we are
I don't have a great answer
Mostly because    I hate that class and I don't want to show how angry I am at it, only to    be completely shut down
I also kind of hate telling people publicly    "you're just wrong, and MY way is the right way" when they trust me not    to
as they do in an AP English class

Whoop-de-doo
Hey Abby
It's lucky
I wasn't just being lazy and not finishing your    letter, I was waiting for the right time
Obviously
You know, in like 10 years (maybe less, maybe more) I wonder what I'll    remember from high school
I know I'll definitely remember you, but how    much of you will stick in my mind
For some reason, I feel really young
Like my whole life is in front of    me, and I don't know a thing
But I also    feel like everyone is older than me
More mature
Stronger
Smarter
Well,    maybe not smarter, but I feel like an idiot like half my life (yeah,    especially right now
Now that you're done high school, do you feel any different
I've always    wondered about that
I feel like I'm still just a kid
and I'm just    wasting it away
I guess that's just how young people are
Unlike my brothers, I could just abandon my old    life and start fresh here
My new life is pretty good
Almost everyone I    know is a good person
I feel like the worst person I know sometimes
Does everyone feel like that sometimes
I've noticed that sometimes in    movies and TV shows and books (and basically any epic story
I don't think so
At least, I hope not
I think part of the problem is that when people care about you, you're    afraid of hurting them
And when you care about someone, you're REALLY    afraid of hurting them
It's hard to care about people
Maybe that's why I'm so different than Kevin and Vincent
It used to seem    like they didn't care about New Jersey at all
Kevin was so attached to    his old life, but I just jumped into this new one
I care about my new life
I'm attached to the people around here (well, I    guess Kevin was too
Vincent
Hmm, I donno
It's sad to think about    you and Dave and Jamie and everyone going away
It's actually really scary to think about me leaving
In a way, I'm kind    of hoping nobody likes me
so they won't be sad to see me go
When I think about college, it makes me feel kind of hollow
Everyone says    you change so much, and learn so much
Does that mean everything I know    now is just fake
Am I really so shallow now that I can be molded into    something completely different
More importantly, how am I going to just leave home
I don't want the    people I care about to get hurt
They would probably be more hurt if I    didn't get into a good school though
Well, anyways, I hope I don't let you down
And by that, I mean I hope I    get into a good school and that I wrote you a good letter
It was hard
I was afraid that you wouldn't like it
After all, I care    about you
Ummm
have fun in college
Bye
Hard and Soft     That's my life now
Hard and Soft
My recent habits with emotional holidays are probably ruining me
For    example: today I wore a pj shirt all day
I think it might have smelled a    bit off
I felt almost proud to be able to say "You don't have to come to    school, you just have to show up
and eventually my mind    followed
It drifted back to bed a few times, and all morning was pretty    unable to think clearly
Hard and Soft really defines my life right now
Sarah
Me
It's sad, and good
I remember a long time ago, I used to say "she'll take your soul, and rip    it to shreds in front of you
and you'll still love her
Unable to convince myself that what I was doing was    stupid
Just getting dragged in
Recently, a single image has hit me, and I'm not exactly positive when or    why
It's an XKCD-esque stick figure scene, where a guy is doing a backflip off    a cliff into the great beyond
and a girl is running off the cliff and    diving to try and "save him"
They're both going to fall
They both made    the conscious choice to jump off the cliff
They'll both die
The caption reads "Catch me
If you can
I think it's romantic
But, as Laura said when I showed it to her "You    have problems
He's willingly launching himself off
and doing    it in a showy, fun way
I can't remember, but there was something deeper
Is he saying "catch me if you can"
Is it in good humor, or is it dark (I    wish someone would catch me
But I'm not falling off a cliff, and to catch    me, you can stay safe
He's deliberately asking the impossible
but what's going on
Hard and Soft
How exactly did I ask
Hmm
Well, first was a long time ago, where she    honestly said she wasn't doing anything
but gave no interest in seeing    me
When I called, no answer
I said earlier "well, I'll call you
or    maybe not
If I don't it's because I'm either busy
or lazy
or hate    you
You'll have to sit by the phone and decide which"     "Oh, thanks"     Yeah
really a bad move on my part
Later, I brought up that she didn't answer, she said her phone was dead
I    didn't know they could ring for so long when they're dead
So, the next time I brought the subject up, she offered me doughnuts
I wanna go out with you
can I have that
but you CAN have a doughnut
hard and soft comes in 10/8-10/12
On Monday (my formal rejection    happened a little over a week before this
She wasn't there, and I was in need of some sort of physical    attention, so Jenna let me play with her hands for a bit
I was sitting    practically in the middle of the hall looking towards the wall
Suddenly, I feel something soft and warm wrap itself around my body, and    it feels good
After a split second of just being overcome with the    softness of it all, I kind of get interested in who's hugging me
A few    seconds of confusion, and I see Sarah snuggling up against me
It's    perfect
On Friday afternoon, she asked me to deliver her Innisbrook Order Form off    to Mr
Elpus, because she forgot to, but would miss her bus
I did
I settled down and closed my eyes as I took her hand in mine, still    wrapped lovingly around me
Suddenly she said "but this still doesn't mean I'm going to go out with    you
now that I have long hair
are you sure
It felt so good, but so    incredibly tainted by the reality of the situation
She was in a weird position, we were both in the middle of    the hallway, and she was practically sitting on her Goldfish
She    unwrapped and came beside me
I couldn't be there anymore
I got away
The next two days I didn't see her around at all
But the next time I did,    she was a little colder
Then, Laura tried to steal me away during a morning at Sarah's locker
Sarah held on to me, and held me in her arms, protecting and keeping me
Soft
But I'm not sure if I can take it
Hard
I feel so cold to her recently
When I think of how she's ever been to me, its soft and hard
Soft on the    outside, going with pretty much whatever I want (holding her hands,    following her around, being weird, hugging
But on the inside, still    hard against me
And now I'm becoming hard
trying not to think of her and failing    miserably
Hey hey hey
Owen
What happens if you phrase a matter of utter Triviality as one of GREAT    IMPORTANCE
Oh, you mean like that
nothing
He's sharp
What happens if you phrase a matter of utter Triviality as one of GREAT    IMPORTANCE
Tessa Replies sarcastically
Ah, I see
Then it blocks you from phrasing it to imply a command
I mean    what happens when YOU do it
Then everyone REPLIES WITH CRECENDO
Was the heroic pose and crescendo really necessary
Lower your voice
I guess that would be the answer
or at least one of them
The answer to what
The question of what to do when we exclude a bunch of others from our    super secret private conversation
Certain things are only really funny    when viewed from the outside
and since they're on the outside, then    they can see them as really funny
Ah
So if we practice a sort of skit/repeatedly have a strange    conversation that requires externality to be considered humorous, then it    would be perfect
But what about if it's only funny if you're external to    both ourselves and the target external group
because that would seem to    be the most common type of humor (for example, on sitcoms)
What happens if you phrase a matter of great importance as one of utter    triviality
Is this a test
Damn it
yes
What happens if you phrase a matter of great importance as one of utter    triviality
Is this a test
No, actually this is just a stupid question
What happens if you phrase a matter of great importance as one of utter    triviality
I think, possibly everyone will talk in quiet, subdued voices, and then    after something happens (like a flower falling to the ground, or a drop of    water splashing) we'll all fly into combat, trying to go for one hit    kills
What happens if you phrase a matter of great importance as one of utter    triviality
You tend to keep everyone calmer
and it's also very funny when viewed    externally
Is this a joke
I'm about 100% sure that this question is really stupid    and pointless though
very disrespectful
Well, probably, you'll get a lot of information on the person you're    talking to
Especially on whether they're feeling sarcastic at the time or    not
Also, you'll probably cheer someone up from being deeply    philosophical (it's really not healthy
bad for the skin and face)
countered
I think
Also useful
Well, they're either awesome geniuses, or they've been hanging around you    too long
It might also be their secret mission to screw up your little    games
Perhaps they get a perverse sexual pleasure from fucking with you
I wasn't serious     What happens if you phrase a matter of great importance as one of utter    triviality
I wasn't serious (would that actually make sense
Did    Owen ever ask to be the keeper of my secrets
No, but he did ask to have    my external memory (essentially)
Also, though we have made no certain    terms of it, we have entered a contract called "best friends" I think
I'm    not sure if I'll be able to handle the responsibility
If only we all knew the right questions to ask, what would life be for
I keep so many secrets now, too many to count
The only one right now I can think of regretting is keeping them, when    angel choruses would sing at the truth
All I wanted was for her to know, and now that's screwed up too
The brain is a funny thing, telling lies when panicked
I just couldn't    say it
Its sad when you lie to lose something you    want so dearly
Now, maybe, it'll never work     And now, I'm still haunted by thoughts of her
but i dont want to     what i want to do is tell the most recent story behind sasha
kelly was once a big freaking jerk and decided not to give me ANY feedback    on "the most exciting time
and i think it would probably be a lot    smarter to finish that first before making a new chapter     i mean
if you dont have any background on the characters, then why    would you care when the writer tries to develop that character
maybe it would work better if i had more time, but i have to do math hw,    and then sleep so i can go to morning practice     other than that, i had a good writing day     i worked on NHS for the longest time, i wrote a story about Jared, and a    story about kelly     and
now i have math hw
but umm      i just lost the point of writing this letter     seeing as mariss hasnt read the thing that i'm talkingabout     because it was andrew     freaking andrew
anyways, its only 5 pgs so far
i need it longer     it'll cover a whole week     instead of that one time that i tried to get one day into 20 pgs (kelly    didn't read that
so you two are just being impossible)     but yeah
that ended up with me tired all the time, obsessed with    writing at like 1 in the morning, and it didn't come out that great     unless mariss decided to go out with me after i wrote it           well, to make a long story short and not very detailed
i will give you the basic outline of something i have planned
for really
no reason
i'm going to start off on just an offhand note
and then get really into    it (this is great practice for in REAL conversations where you always have    to be ready to tell a story
today in physics i told the story about    Jared and the race
it was great fun
and in Soc yesterday i got to    tell the story of my childhood with the Janitor and the President and    "attitude adjustment" and the suckup idea)     offhand note: "sasha's really cute and cuddly, but super    sophisticated-like"     i mean
i really like her     what can't you like, especially with cute cuddly, but super    sophisticated-like people     its like Erin Franz, only younger and less cute, less cuddly, and less    super sophisticated-like     there can never be a replacement for the ORIGINAL "cute little bear"     ever     so don't even try     (oh man kelly, lampshade is starting to play perfectly to me launching    into a kindof sad, kindof happy, and mostly jsut weird story that i    promised not to tell
how fitting
btw, did everyone really love how i    slowly introduced you to this amazing story
i know i did
every time something happens to her, i really feel like just giving her a    tight hug and saying "awww poooor baby
are you alright
she's way too smart/super sophisticated-like for that, and for    two, she's so cute and cuddly that she's definitely off limits to mortal    hands
It's just not going to work
plus, my brain would probably explode trying to comprehend how cute and    cuddly she is
ouch     and, whenever i think of hugging her, theres a lot of other things to    consider
i dont want this to be like Rosie or Eva where i just fucked    everything up to hell, and will probably never be fully forgiven
and    Plus, Sasha knows basically everything about me
and i'm sure every time    i'm around she'll remember how messed up things got with Eva, and how i'm    not quite normal
and on the other hand, I'm not sure if i would want to    be with someone like Sasha
especially if i always feel this awkward    around her
She was sick on Monday, and all day i worried about her
It was just in    the back of my mind sitting there, and in band i have this awful habit of    just looking around the room at everyone
and i usually get a bit stuck    when i see someone cute
which is a huge problem because the cute people    generally are there every day
and so i get distracted every day because    of sasha and lisa
seriously
i feel like a goldfish
five second memory
so
then she came back
it was so exciting     i wanted to give her a big old hug and ask if she was better     so i visited her little room with her enormous tuba     she was sick
still     drinking tea     it smelled good     and looked good     and she said "its tea"     "i know
so i said it kinda pissy     and then i just cleared the world and it was just me and her in a little    room     This amazing rush flew through me
You know when you finish a race
and    it was really easy, but you PR'ed by like a minute
god) well, that's what happened
I felt, like, electricity flowing through me
i hopped around and i    looked at everything in the room and my fingers felt like they were about    to shoot lighting bolts everywhere
i felt like giving her a hug and sharing this amazing feeling, but i    thought "she's sick" and she probably wouldn't appreciate it very much
instead i said just whatever came to mind
prancing about the room, i asked about how she was, and if she was better,    and if she would get better, and how things were going, and everything,    and then suddenly there was something really cool
there was this little wire mesh thing sitting there with a little loopy    thing attached and it looked like a sultan's hat in wire-frame or maybe    one of those outdoor food covers so flies dont get the food, only made for    inch wide flies
you're supposed to put those in so that
i was laughing and laughing when i ran    away
i felt kinda awkward with that much energy
She found it rather amusing
I always feel bad for sasha
for one she's sick, for two she has that    big ol' Tuba, and for three, she has to carry her folder AND a book and    trashcan so that she can rest the Tuba on something when she's playing
It    seems kinda goofy, but i always want to carry her things for her
but    i'd probably put it all sideways or something
or i'd fall down and look    really foolish or break something or someone
well, i was going to help her out, but she sort of disappeared and then i    had to go and i was already being our saxophone slave
When we finished the Sr
Citizen's Luncheon, i got some cookies and a    drink :P seniors must not be very hungry or thirsty
i was :P     anyways, then, we all got
settled back at the High School (marissa way    to ruin the abbreviation HS for highschool for me FOREVER now i'll always    thing of dumb old HiStory
and i came up behind her and    looked over her shoulder
she turned back and smiled at me kinda goofy
and felt really    really foolish the whole time
its called rock paper    scissors
and lisa was busy flirting with    andrew
and kita was fun because he had stings to play with on his    sweatshirt (i played rock paper scissors with him too, but it wasn't as    fun
and
there were her hands
they're soft, and    delicate looking, and well shaped, and
perfectish
and
i liked them
they were good hands
Sasha is really too cute for words
i always feel awkward around her
She asked me why
and i couldn't really put it out there
i think i screwed up
because when she asked me
it was like a fork in    the road
I go straight and dont tell her that it's because she's just too    cute and i really like her, or i tell her and see what happens
and at practice: "Jeff do you still feel awkward around me

You may come off as    too<br>childish but only because your not burdened<br>with all the rules    and regulations of<br>adulthood
You are carefree most of the    time<br>spending your days playing tag or naming all<br>the clouds you see    in the sky
You are<br>generally kind to everyone because you have<br>lots    of love and happiness to share
Making<br>friends comes easy because they    strive for the<br>innocence you possess but be careful, being as<br>nice    and kind hearted as you are people will<br>try to manipulate your nature    if they have not<br>already

You are so sweet your<br>almost    angelic, you find joy in others<br>happiness and cannot stand to see    anyone in<br>pain
You want to make everyone around you feel<br>good about    themselves and if someone is upset<br>you can tend to become rather upset    as well<br>which means you are sympathetic and raise<br>others above    yourself
Being as kind and<br>good-natured as you are people have most    likely<br>hurt you in the past but you pick yourself up<br>every time
You    may look fragile but you are<br>stronger than most tend to see
Life    is<br>beautiful no matter how you look at it and you<br>understand that    people make mistakes, not<br>everyone is perfect
You try to see the good    in<br>the bad which is a talent few posses, dont ever<br>let anyone change    you
You truly have a<br>beautiful soul inside and a heart of gold

Jeffrey63090 [6:09 PM]:   it was a long time ago
about two months ago    Jeffrey63090 [6:09 PM]:   and
i was mooching a ride off of my senior    friend
who hates me    Jeffrey63090 [6:09 PM]:   and he told me
if you want a ride, you have to    find marrissa    Jeffrey63090 [6:10 PM]:   at this point
im thinking    Jeffrey63090 [6:10 PM]:   do i KNOW a marrissa
bEcCaB0021 [6:10 PM]:   lol    bEcCaB0021 [6:10 PM]:   k    Jeffrey63090 [6:10 PM]:   so i say "
whats she look like"    Jeffrey63090 [6:10 PM]:   "how the hell should i know" says Ben, "just    find her and ask her if she needs a ride"    Jeffrey63090 [6:10 PM]:   (riiiiiight)    Jeffrey63090 [6:11 PM]:   so
seeing as this is after cross country    practice    bEcCaB0021 [6:11 PM]:   yea    Jeffrey63090 [6:11 PM]:   i go and RUN through the school asking everyone    i know if they've seen Marrissa
Jeffrey63090 [6:11 PM]:   and
a few random people    bEcCaB0021 [6:11 PM]:   lol    Jeffrey63090 [6:12 PM]:   so, im soon pointed in her direction
and    theres two people gathered near one locker
Jeffrey63090 [6:12 PM]:   so i just glance at both of them
if i were feeling creative i    would discribe her
her beatiful shining teeth
her lusty shining    golden hair
Jeffrey63090 [6:13 PM]:   lol, just kidding    Jeffrey63090 [6:13 PM]:   (not at that stage yet)    bEcCaB0021 [6:14 PM]:   lol her luscious lips    bEcCaB0021 [6:14 PM]:   lol    bEcCaB0021 [6:14 PM]:   her curvy thighs    bEcCaB0021 [6:14 PM]:   lol lmao    Jeffrey63090 [6:14 PM]:   oooook    Jeffrey63090 [6:14 PM]:   right

skipping much later
to
the    twenty first    bEcCaB0021 [6:16 PM]:   OK    Jeffrey63090 [6:16 PM]:   no
about a little before that
bEcCaB0021 [6:16 PM]:   ok    Jeffrey63090 [6:16 PM]:   lots of
goofing off during homeroom in the    halls    Jeffrey63090 [6:16 PM]:   as usual    Jeffrey63090 [6:16 PM]:   and i hear "marrissa like you" it was very    random
so i thought    Jeffrey63090 [6:16 PM]:   i just shrugged it off
Jeffrey63090 [6:17 PM]:   and THEN
on the twenty first
Jeffrey63090 [6:17 PM]:   (get on the edge of you seat
bEcCaB0021 [6:17 PM]:   OK    Jeffrey63090 [6:17 PM]:   (im hungry and want a banana
bEcCaB0021 [6:18 PM]:   u told her ur hungry and want a banana

about the day befor the 21st    bEcCaB0021 [6:19 PM]:   kk    Jeffrey63090 [6:19 PM]:   of october
bEcCaB0021 [6:19 PM]:   ok    Jeffrey63090 [6:19 PM]:   hmmmmmmmmmmm exactly how did all this happen    Jeffrey63090 [6:19 PM]:   hmmmmmmm i think sometime
Jeffrey63090 [6:19 PM]:   i forget when
bEcCaB0021 [6:19 PM]:   :'(    Jeffrey63090 [6:20 PM]:   anyway, on the bus from one of our x-country    meets, we sat together
and had a long rambling meaningless conversation    Jeffrey63090 [6:20 PM]:   maybe AFTER the twenty first    Jeffrey63090 [6:20 PM]:   but the twenty first is when she gave me that    letter    Jeffrey63090 [6:20 PM]:   yeah    Jeffrey63090 [6:20 PM]:   well anyway    Jeffrey63090 [6:21 PM]:   then i sort of avoided her
because i was    scared
because i liked her too    Jeffrey63090 [6:21 PM]:   and
that usually doesnt happen to me
so    avoidance    Jeffrey63090 [6:21 PM]:   lots of randomness    Jeffrey63090 [6:21 PM]:   and then soon
hanging outage    Jeffrey63090 [6:21 PM]:   ohhhhhhhh right    Jeffrey63090 [6:21 PM]:   i remember
b4 the twenty first
she was    saying that she doesnt like her boyfriend    Jeffrey63090 [6:22 PM]:   yeah

the RING    Jeffrey63090 [6:22 PM]:   etc
etc
Jeffrey63090 [6:22 PM]:   dinner time
How are you
Whoa, hey
This was originally my CD
What are you doing with it
Well, lets go into the complete story about my CD which is now yours
Or, you could throw this away and make off with your brand spankin' new    CD
Well, I could start off by going to Sunday
I was going to Delaware, so I    was busy calling everyone in Delaware who I had a phone number for, which    was all of 3 people
Wow, this story is off to a really bad start
This is    supposed to be a comedy, but is quickly becoming a dramatic tragedy
Well, my choices were to either try to find some phone numbers which I    knew were in my closet, somewhere, or I could go shopping with my parents
I took the easy way out (hey, my closet is big enough to hold my bed in    this house, not meaning to brag or anything)
Well anyway, it seems like a    good time to tell you, if you don't like No Doubt and kind of want to get    rid of the CD, then that's just too bad because I bought it in Delaware,    haha
Devilish laugh
Well, I have like 3 hours to burn and we decide to go to Target, where by    chance they have a very nice electronics section
Hey, no matter how nice,    odd or *profanity* I may seem, I'm only a guy and am therefore drawn to    the hum of electricity like a moth to a flame
That was almost but not    quite poetic
Wow this is some nice writing, too bad it's just so boring
Ahhhh, but    that's my life now
Well, anyway, here I am with nothing to do at all but peruse (ooh
SAT    word
look it up
Aww, so sweet
No not really, I just feel guilty for everything
Haha, I decide to get a CD for me, but say it's for you and hope you hate    No Doubt
Well, that could be what happened, but its not
Its like I took the script    and threw it out the window
Now, we're adlibbing with real time thought    flow as seen on T
V
Let's rewind my life for a few days
Here's me at lunch at my table, and I'm sitting all bored like, so I bring    up a really personal question
Everyday, I get a fork, no matter what I have for lunch
What kind of    person am I
That's what they call OCD
Also, I'm always thinking I have    some kind of disease
That's like, hypochondria or something
I'm also the    most insecure person I can think of, and I'm weird by even the person with    a psycho aunt's standards
That's sad     Well anyway, they ask why I'd think that
What do I do
I be me and get    all defensive
Wow, this is becoming an    entire essay
If you have the attention span to read even this far, I    congratulate you
Speaking of you (where did I get off topic anyway
You're supposed to be the topic here, but I just stole the show
Either that or I'm just really distant
When I kind of realized this, I called you up, but you were busy
Maybe, I should call again
Somehow that seems like a really stupid idea     This is becoming just like "Adaptation
Either that or "Being John Malkovich
When The Singles came    out I so wanted to get it, but I was not really that ready to jump on the    idea of spending all that money on a CD I could get off the internet for    free
Hey that's what you do anyway right
Well back to me being at the Delaware Target, I ask my mom (do you call    your mom, mom or mommy, I call her mommy-that's just me
Right now I'm listening to my burnt copy, on track 6, I've never heard    this song, ever
Well anyway, what my mom says is "why do you need a CD"     Here comes a brilliant idea: "I need a birthday present for my friend
Of course my mom catches me and says, "you're getting your friend that    you've know for at most 6 months a present and you don't even get me a    present on my birthday
Caught
Panic
my    girlfriend
You know, I wrote a paper exactly like this for class
I failed, no redo    allowed
Right now I'm on "Underneath It All" so if a say anything kind of funky,    lets just say that Gwen (you know, the lead singer of No Doubt
Well, here I go into the CDs, so theres this whole section that says Best    Sellers
I go over to that side just to see if I'm "current" on hit music
Turns out, I am
Anyway, there's Hey this story has way too many sidetracking stories     Anyway, there's No Doubt: The Singles 1992-2003 right in front of me
Then, my own guilt sinks in
I start to think, "uh shouldn't I actually    give her the CD
FYI, not that you ever cared, I like Rock: No Doubt, Trapt, Simple Plan    and The All American Rejects are some of my favorites
I hate Rap too
You know I have a saying
Well, having my guilt sunk in, I look at all the best seller CDs because    people tend to like bands to get the band into the best seller section
Well now, I see all my favorites, in that little list above, and all these    other people
I had a "gut feeling" about getting Shania Twain in UP
If    you say that you wanted that, then that would make me feel really bad and    make me feel really good at the same time
I'm sad anyway-just take the    frickin' CD
Oops, I could delete that last comment, but that would ruin the entire    theme of me spilling my thoughts on this whole fiasco
Right about now I just want to apologize for any kind of death threat    phone calls that some of my friends may have given because of you not    liking me
They said some pretty strange things about that
Hey, I'm on Don't Speak
This was my best friend's (in first grade,    literally, I liked her) favorite song
Every time I thought about her this    song came to mind
In the end, I accidentally guilted myself into giving you this CD
Now you    have a CD tainted by my own sadness
Sorry for that too
I cant believe    that this paper took an hour to write, I didn't know how fast time can go    when you don't have to tell lies to survive, but only on paper is the    world good enough to do otherwise
Literally
I guess theres really nothing else to say, exept to apologize for    accidentally getting my friends hating you
As Lisa C
says, "We like you    Jeff, just not in that way
What the Hell
Do you MIND
You know, I really feel like saying that to like everyone I know
The way    my life is, its just getting utterly ridiculous
I want to go up to Sra
Rivera and say "Mrs
Rivera, do you have any idea    how incredibly hard it is to try to learn Spanish in my free time when I    don't even have enough time to do all the REAL classwork I have
This is    just ridiculous
To which I say    "And what's up with Spanish not being spelled "SPAIN-ish"
I'm sorry, but    that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of
Rivera would probably say something like "Well, nobody said you had to get    into Spanish 5 Honors
And why are you in my classroom
It's like PDA times    10000
The weirdest part is how they do it in front of her sister all day
What's even weirder is that It's not the usually weirdo stuff that I see
Instead of a kiss and a hug, and then they move on
these two cuddle for    hours just randomly
Don't they have anywhere to go
Maybe to like
a    hotel room
What bothers me even more is Jackie Mayer
That's right, I'm picking on    the silent kid
Like seriously
If you're going to be beautiful, could you    try not to be so damn shy
I don't even think she's shy
I think she's    just really quiet so people like me feel like heathens when they sit next    to her
It's one of the most annoying things I've ever encountered in my    life
And it makes me feel ridiculously uncomfortable
I just want to get    away from her
Its like when you're sitting and talking to a monk who is    dirt poor, taken all the most sacred oaths (except, obviously, silence),    devoted his entire life to goodness, and says everything with a complete    sense of peace and serenity
And you're just like "wow, I suck
to the guilt and the inferiority
Last night, I was trying to fall asleep when for some reason I got    thinking of band
I don't know why exactly (I think I was trying to leave    like 5 min
early to go to the Lunch table so I wouldn't be "late" in Kids    for Kids's eyes), but Schwartzer made a pretty big deal about it
In my    mind I started going on the most ridiculous rant
I started complaining    about basically random things, based in most part on the people around me    that have been bugging me
but I still    get annoyed with it anyway
Like    seriously
What the hell
Could you try not to be so damn cute all the    time
Its really obnoxious
Seriously, even if you put on like 1000 layers    of clothes, and then covered yourself with mud, and nobody had any clue    who it was, you'd probably irradiate cuteness wherever you went
Little    butterflys and daisys and stuff would start shooting out of your breathing    hole or whatever
Seriously, I'm not even kidding
Like what the hell
You're like ridiculously cute
You're like 1000 times cuter than Erin    Franz was
And when you get that cute you can melt faces and turn    rainclouds into sunshine
My basement is flooded, by the way, were you    away this weekend or something
Could've used you
Sorry if I embarrassed    you, but it's kind of a big deal
It's been bugging me for a while
That's    why I can never talk to you exactly
And why I'm always so stupid and    awkward around you
I mean
more than usual
Which is pretty bad
Like, if you took how cute you are
that's about how awkward I am around    you
Maybe that's why its been raining so much around here
Abby, don't    give me that look
Seriously
Oh yeah, you need to stop being so beautiful    too
It's so weird that you're like sexy and want to be my friend
I mean    seriously
Do you mind
Its really distracting
AND LAURA
Geeze, would you make up your mind already
God
You're like a    flippin'
OR    SOMETHING
GEEZE
One minute you're really sweet and cute
The next you're    trying to kill everyone and want us all to go to hell and leave you alone
GAH
At this point I sort of realize nobody remembers Erin Franz
Mostly    because even in my mind people were whispering around
Wait
You don't know Erin Franz
THE cute little bear
Wow, what do they    teach you kids these days
Well, a long time ago, there was this person    who was ridiculously cute
It was an immutable law that if you were cuter    than her
you were breaking the cuteness barrier
That's like going    faster than the speed of light
It's not supposed to happen
ever
Hey Nick Gabinet
what does immutable mean again
I'm using it right
right
I want to say immutable
not sure if it's the right word though
And
NICK GABINET
I don't even know what to say about you
Seriously
What the hell
I don't even know where to start
I'll see you all later
I have to go right now
Sorry
Schwartzer tries to re-iterate that the whole reason I lost it was because    he wouldn't let me go
Oh yeah
Schwartzer, there's something I've been meaning to tell you for a while
You're a pretty cool guy
I like you
Except for the fact that you're    Schwartzer
If you were anybody else, you'd be pretty cool
But you're    not
So you suck
And I have to hate you
I'm sorry
That's just the way things have to be
I have to go now
Bye
As the murmers and the "WTF was THAT
I turn around one last    time and scream "I CAN HEAR YOU, YOU KNOW
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT UNTIL    AFTER I LEAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT ME
Not me
Not now, you should say
When you're half the age of a highschool senior, you dont need to care
When you're the happy-go-lucky fourth grader, these things dont matter
When the world looks down and pities you, you know that you need to open    you're eyes, and not before then right
When you're too young to know what politics are, and too delighted at    everything, you'll never be alone
When you're just sober enough to    realize that you were wrong give me a call
When you get back from you're    long tour of popularity and get clean from the powerful drug of happyness,    come pay me a visit
When the lies of the "friends" who don't care are    finally deciphered, come to my room
It's not very clean, and there's no    one around but me
Just me and myself
Just me and and endless stack of    stories that only I have the time to read
Just me and my wild    imagination
Just me and this paper and this pencil, writing and hoping
Writing and hoping that you'll come
This might not make any sense to you, and much of it is not my own words,    but it has to be said, or at least thought about being said
You're wrong
Completely
Or, possibly (more accurately), THAT'S Wrong
Completely
I'm the sort of person that believes in magic, and ghosts, and dragons,    and fairytales, and Santa Claus, and myths, and Gods, and gods (lowercase    g), and true love, and destiny, and everything
I used to think "if you can imagine it, then that means it's real
If I can imagine myself flying, and shooting fireballs out of    my hands, then it's real enough for it to matter
Or at least mean    something
I was thinking, trying to figure out exactly who I am, when I remembered    our last conversation
Is who I am made up of what I do, what choices I    make, what I say, what I think, what I feel, or whatever
I say that the    answer shouldn't be what I do, because there's so much that you can't do,    no matter what
And as for my choices, that's not a real measure of who I    am, because there's so much inside me that I never chose to be, and I'm    pretty sure about half of my personality is a creative build to work    around who I was born and raised to be, and pick something that I wanted    for myself, once I got old enough to figure out it was too late
To be honest, that is sounding a lot like excuses
And it pretty much is
Also, it's not exactly true to what I was thinking at first
I was more thinking about which one of the people within others am I
You remember me as someone
but is that who I am
Or at least, who I am    to you
And is it even who I was, even for just a second
More importantly, who you are has completely changed
That sounds really harsh on purpose, but    it's really not all that bad
I was going to ask for permission, but I've    decide to be an ass to you and just not
Or, if you're feeling merciful,    give me a really handsome scar, and I'll say for all time "this is where    Sasha, the Untouchable left her mark
I once thought she was the cutest    person ever, and over time she became corrupted by the evils of cruel    reality
She chose the path of the cat
Beautiful, smart, quick, deadly    and lovable
Catch me if you can
I think I know what it means
Lately its been through my thoughts a lot
I've only looked at it really    hard a few times
I felt an express satisfaction the first time I drew it    (on Mr
Shrager's college App Packet)
It came to me sort of out of the    blue and the first thing I thought of was XKCD comics
The thing is, I    remember dreaming it up, but w don't remember when that moment was
I just    know that it first appeared on Shrager's packet
I was proud of it because    it was nearly exactly what I had wanted
That's one of the good things    about having thought of it in stick figure terms
The only part I had to    think about was the cliff
The drawing was perfect
Strange, wry, cute, tragic, and a little    enigmatic all at once
It was a mix between XKCD humor and intellect, with    a bit of my own twisted sense of love
It was the long ago when I first thought of falling and falling and    falling
and being slowly enveloped by a warm darkness that was formed    into a soothing, but tight embrace
The almost suffocating hug was both    sad and happy, killing as it blessed
A woman formed from the    darkness-wrapping me in her warm embrace
and telling me soothing    words
She stopped my fall, saving me, but cursing me to live without    her
As I cried alone in the endless darkness, safe but more dead than    ever, I watched her fall and merge with the endless darkness below
On some nights I couldn't sleep, I would play this image
I could feel the    fall (it was an incredibly relaxing thought to be falling forever
I always wondered whether    I would ever meet her
But this drawing was a little different
It showed a willing jumper,    playful in his leap
But the words were what really drove the puzzle
If you can
I can imagine him    grinning back to her, saying the first half, and then leaping out, as the    final bit burst out, as if from the depths below the cliff
The second    half of the phrase carried an almost inhuman power, and hit the air with a    tangible shockwave
He backflips high and far off the cliff
The girl has no chance of saving him
She doesn't even have time to think
She simply acts
Sprinting toward the edge, she prepares to dive, and is    frozen forever
I told Laura, the first time I showed it to her "I think it's romantic
This is what I wrote on "Hard and Soft" about this     I remember a long time ago, I used to say "she'll take your soul, and rip    it to shreds in front of you
and you'll still love her
Unable to convince myself that what I was doing was    stupid
Just getting dragged in
Recently, a single image has hit me, and I'm not exactly positive when or    why
It's an XKCD-esque stick figure scene, where a guy is doing a backflip off    a cliff into the great beyond
and a girl is running off the cliff and    diving to try and "save him"
They're both going to fall
They both made    the conscious choice to jump off the cliff
They'll both die
The caption reads "Catch me
If you can
I think it's romantic
But, as Laura said when I showed it to her "You    have problems
He's willingly launching himself off
and doing    it in a showy, fun way
I can't remember, but there was something deeper
Is he saying "catch me if you can"
Is it in good humor, or is it dark (I    wish someone would catch me
But I'm not falling off a cliff, and to catch    me, you can stay safe
He's deliberately asking the impossible
but what's going on
The thing is, at the time I didn't really feel that it WAS very romantic
I just felt that this was the way things should be
When I looked at it    closer today, I felt it was suddenly a much stronger picture
Before I had thought "I wish someone would catch me as I fall
Is it a challenge to her to    try to hopelessly succeed
Catch me
IF YOU CAN
and she can't
But I was sitting in study hall
Listening to Marissa talk about her diet
When I did it, I was pretty shocked by how little I ate and inflated my    consumptions to fit what I thought was normal (I added a bit of desert    that usually I only have one to 3 times a week)
Also, about 1/2 of my    calories came from drinks, if I remember correctly (I didn't, but I had    about 500 calories out of 3000 as liquids)
Marissa had pretty much    nothing in her diet, and started telling us all about her almost    ridiculous amount of pickiness
She lives almost exactly the same day in    and day out
Her routine (though tight before) is almost set in stone
I    looked at her, and saw a mix of fear, anxiety, and laughter as she    described it all to us (probably just my imagination)
She switched all    this with disbelief and indignant shock when she switched the subject to    how her mom tries to expose her to new foods by mixing in small impurities    with her food
Another thing is that Marissa forces herself to eat Meat    only because of running
That's understandable
but I looked down at    another copy of the same drawing and suddenly felt myself running towards    a cliff and diving off it
I felt like looking her straight in the eye and saying "Well what the hell    would YOU do if someone was developing OCD in front of your eyes
You're    mom's just trying to help
You can't just live exactly the same way every    day
It's impossible
I'm glad we're not together anymore
You Scare me"     And she did
She scared me
I felt almost as if I was watching a close    friend get locked up and sent away
The bell rang, and she went to class
I stayed, overcome by a feeling of hopelessness, and stared at the    picture
It was suddenly much more meaningful
Besides, what right did I    have
Who gave me the power to judge others on the way they live
I'm glad I'm a runner
I think I was going a little nuts with only two    days off this weekend
Everything bottles up inside me
I'm too used to    having somewhere to send it all
I felt a lot better after about 2 minutes    of quickly jogging alone
and came back to the team
At least somewhere    I can belong
Who's going to catch Marissa
Is she even jumping
I guess not
I'm just    sensitive
Besides, OCD isn't really that bad, is it
She'll be fine, even    if nobody catches her
Final notes: I felt angry at Richard for a minute
as if this were his    fault
I thought "what did you do
when I left her, she wasn't this bad
And I didn't leave her
And she chose him
And odds are, he    didn't do a thing
Don't You Sleep
Yes, but I can choose not to
I learned a trick
something that can be used to extend a day into two    or three, with only a few hours spent sleeping
But after that, it gets    dangerous
One of the major problems is time skipping
You're doing a monotonous    activity while you think about your next move
Eating while listening to    some music
Playing with whatever's on the table in front of you
Staring    out into space
All of a sudden, without falling asleep, or daydreaming, or noticing    anything at all, you're two songs lower on your playlist, or you check    your watch again and 20 minutes have passed, or suddenly you notice that    you've run out of time
It happens when your mind is tired, even if you're not
The other major problem is that you lose a lot of appreciation for life
The hours between 4 and 6 are deadly quiet
And the whole world is slowly    flipping
And you've noticed that everything is always standing still
The little hug that could
That's not the greatest title
I think there copyright problem going    on or something
Oh well, who cares
I think if it ever comes up in court,    there's a chance the judge will let me off if I plead "all's fair in love    and war
awww how    sweet
Too bad 20 years from now I'll know better, but until then I'm    still young and alive so lets just throw all cares into the wind and    charge into this next gallivanting adventure
Well, ever since Marissa dumped me, I was you know, just hanging out
Something was different
Instead of just noticing that I had a lot of    friends that were girls, and practically none that were guys, I started to    notice that everybody around me was really hot
And now ordinarily this    would mean something, like I'm in the playboy Mansion or something, but    for me it just means that physical standards are not the highest in my    mind
I was pretty annoyed by all these hot people suddenly popping up    around me
It was not fun to see them all around me
So anyways, this is the story of one, and the little hug that could
It    all started in cross country
That part wasn't very important, but it does bring up some very    good-timing memories of hanging out with you
I think I'm just going to    skip it
a hug
NO, THIS is no ordinary hug
This is a magical hug with fairies and princes
Specifically me and you,    in that order
Sorry, you have to be the prince
Fine
be the fairy, see if I care
So anyways, I was just strolling down the language hall- the funny T at    the end of the 300 hall, going to the 200 hall, when
I discover: A) your    pretty tall, and B) your body feels better than it looks, and that's    pretty darn good
If you were into that sort of thing, you could call it    "OMFG F***in CRAZY good
They lingered even as my legs started pulling me away just as    reluctantly
This time, you said it phenomenally attractively
It    was like every inch of your body focused on that one word, to convey every    emotion you'd ever felt about me
I was a bit shocked, this was an awesome moment
The hug, the Hey, you
It looked like everything was perfect, nothing at    all was wrong
As I turned I shivered from the immense crazed emotions I felt
It was    like, whoa
Wind
Cold
So cold
Gloom
So dense and thick that     You could feel it in your     Bones
That's all I remember
Scrawled on some piece of debris that might once have been paper, it was    cast off, and now, used as a bookmark
When had such beauty of words become so commonplace
Through four lines of writing I could clearly imagine the scene
The rain penetrating even a heavy, thick coat
Soaked to the bone, numbed    everywhere but the mind, which was thinking only through a haze of doubt    and fear
Cold such that you thought you might die, and yet did not care    because you couldn't think quite right
And through it all, the thick haze    all around, blocks off all the senses so that absolutely no hope remains
You sink down into the pleasing, calm darkness and
Below the script, crossed out and nearly illegible said "I know it was    just a dream but
Its not done yet, go ahead if you want
Thank you so much
I always feel so special reading this, like my words    can make an impact
Like I can have an impact
I really can't say thank you enough     And I dunno what to give you in return, so I decided on a song
I wrote    this one not too long ago
It's not done, but I like it so far
It just    needs a litte finishing up
The format didnt transfer well, so i did "/" as a new line and a space    between verses
Tell me what you think, I could send you more if you want
Young and whim-ful, /Pretty and smart,/ In your mother's shadow/ You hid    your heart
So overprotected /Carefree and pure/ But when the dark appeared/ You felt    its allure     Oh Persephone/ Up and left your home/ So alone/ Gotta find you a home     Another world unfolded /Dark, sexy, and new /And there stood; tall, dark,    and handsome/ The Lord of the Damned for you     Oh mischevious angel/ You fell from above/ Fell from light to dark/ Ten    further down to love     Woah-oh-oh
He was the devil,/ Dark angel as well,/ Saying, "Beauty,    take my hand,/ And be my queen of Hell
He could give pleasure/ He could bring pain/ She had so much to lose/ And    even more to gain     Oh ho, but /They called him evil/ They called it rape/ She said, "How    could I be unwilling
Oh Persephone/ Up and left your home /No more alone/ Went and found you a    home
No HW today

And Mr
O'Brien said that us 1st period Honors kids had no ambition or    will to learn

And while that may not seem like all that much,    it's also potentially ridiculously profitable
And fun (in many ways)
Ok, it all started when Anu got pissed about someone opening his backpack
Naturally, the thing to ask is why he's so worried
Honestly, relax
Ben Jarrett has the answer (its practically impossible to tell if he's    serious or not most of the time
Him and Kelsey should have babies
Then    there'd be an unstoppable army of permanently sarcastic-sounding people,    and everyone will get so confused that they'll have to surrender the    world
That's why
I wasn't exactly paying    attention, but Ben observes: "Oh, so you keep your crack in your    hackysack
For example, today in Bio we were talking    about using Jell-o-like "agarose" for DNA gel electrophoresis
Mrs
Lucci    mentioned we were going to have to contain it with masking tape while we    poured it, so it wouldn't flow everywhere
First I imagine we pour it in, and it just    flows all over the table while we stand there stupidly
Then I can imagine    us trying to pick it up, and huge flat slab comes up with it ("hmm, well    what now
Then I get all sorts of images of Agarose floods, and Agarose    monsters trying to eat us up
I just have an active imagination
I kept    laughing and laughing
Well, anyways
I sort of imagine people saying "Hey, wanna hack
Or me saying "hey, wanna buy a crack-hack
then pretending they're just stylish hacks when    the cops come
Or being Mexican or something and being stopped at the border
Nothing suspicious here, move on
I'm a genius
One element of what makes people interesting is that they have lots of    interesting stories to tell
This is a mathematical style proof of why I    am not an interesting person
Statements      1
For me, I am sure I have lots of interesting ideas
2
For me, I have a poor memory
3
For me, I have a weak, boring, or otherwise un-dynamic voice        (generally)      4
Being interesting requires a good story
5
A good story consists of interesting subject matter, a charismatic        voice, and a in-depth knowledge of the event      6
Intelligent people are sometimes good story tellers because they have        the knowledge to be able to form intelligent opinions on a wide range        of subjects
7
The things I find most interesting are generally obscure or        "unimportant"
Modifiers      1
I have been told to shut up an above average number of times
a
Being told to shut up creates a conditioning environment that             instructs the person that they should no longer do x event             because x event leads to y punishment
2
My poor memory inhibits good storytelling because I will often forget        what happens, or where my story is going
Or what words are and mean
Conclusions
1
I have (falsely
NOT FINISHED~
You know Steph
I've been saying a lot that "your life isn't worth    living
I've always felt that there    are certain things in this world
Things that are absolutely necessary    to have a good life
The first is obviously Star Wars
How could you go your entire life    without watching StarWars
IT'S SHOCKING
AND APPALLING
That, and it's totally unacceptable
It's a good thing you have Netflix
So, as soon as it gets up to the top of your queue, you'll be able to life    a normal human life
The next one is your blatant lack of a magic 8 ball
I don't understand    how you can possibly survive without it
From it's simplest answers, to    the thought provoking answer of "better not tell you now", to the    downright annoying "reply hazy, try again" this is the thing that guides    your life
Thankfully, from this day forward, you will never lose your way again
Also, I've learned that the magic 8 ball is your BEST friend when it comes    to relationship advice
Think of it as the tried and true "she loves me
she loves me not
The third thing is much less well known
and you could probably have a    halfway decent life without it
But only HALF-way
There's these weirdo things that expand with water and they look really    sweet
You just HAVE to try them
No life is complete without them
Btw, don't forget to invite me to see it
they're awesome
The Fourth one is having ice cream
But I'm pretty sure you've done that    at least once
The Fifth is having a crush on someone
Aren't you glad you go to an    American Highschool
The Sixth, and last in this list, is tie-dye
It's absolutely vital that at least once you experience the joys and    frustrations of making a tie-dye shirt
and wear it in public
Does it    represent a carefree attitude
A love of bright colors
Drugs
You decide
Happy Birthday
and enjoy the greatness of life
This feels like a sin     It's heavy, like guilt     Why does the world let me get nice and comfortable
Right before it throws these sorts of things at you
It tastes like a sin
You want more, but you know you shouldn't be having any
Like chocolate cake at midnight
It draws you in
It beckons you in, and dares you to dream     "How bad could it be
It could be fun
Especially Girls
Should we resist sins
Like our elders tell us
But would it hurt to try
Am I just scared
The thing is, I was the one who committed it
This is the sin I have brought upon myself
The kind that hurts the most
I could have avoided this whole thing
I shouldn't have hung around
I shouldn't have made promises
Everyone started asking if we were together
We're just alike, can't we be friends
And then I took it further
I used Lindsay to test the waters
I answered every question wrong
I poked around
And for what
Just to see what was going on
Just because I was bored
To see if I could
I hope I don't hurt you
I shouldn't have gotten involved
I hope I'm just misreading a simple note
But it feels like a sin
A fruitful adventure     If you are tagged in this note, it's because you're a runner, live in    Pennington, or both
Two of the most    important things are that I'm a runner, and that I'm lazy
Though the two    seem like they're mutually exclusive, they're not
Especially this time of    year
Pre-season training
is a tough time
Trying to force yourself to get    out for a run is pretty tough, even when (like me) you don't have a job
so there's really not much excuse
It's hot, it's humid, it's tiring, and    you're out of shape
Basically it's god awful
There's also no way I'm    getting up at 8:45 to run at Washington Crossing with the team
But, there is a glimmer of light in the darkness
1) With a little luck,    I'll continue on my 2 day streak(
don't    worry, I have better ones in store), 3) Getting in shape now may lead to    good things in Rutgers Pharm
4) My Raspberries are getting ripe
Well, let me tell you, the answer is    EVERYTHING
And also Yes, I'm about to give you some vital information    that may change your life forever
As some of you may already know, Raspberries are delicious
They are    incredibly tasty
They are, by a decent margin, my favorite berry
Unfortunately, they are not filling, and are rarely in great supply
Many    of you are probably still wondering if this has anything to do with you
Others have figured it out already, and are possibly tying on their    running shoes in haste
Well, what MY berries have to do with anything
is that Kunkle Park has    tons of wild raspberry bushes
So does Washington Crossing Park, but I'm    not exactly sure where
And if MY raspberry bushes are ripe
then the    raspberry bushes in Kunkle must ALSO be ripe
Right
Today, I went on my run for that exact reason
It turns out the answer is,    "Well, not exactly"
Running from my house to Kunkle park takes about 20    minutes
And, me being kind of out of shape, going 40 minutes is kind of    stretching my limits
Mainly boredom
But also, I expect some of you people    have patience, and won't mind waiting a few days (until this story is    over
90% of them are still fully green
im SOOOOOOOO hungry right now     i could eat like
an entire steak dinner
and then some mashed potatoes     and they'd be all yummy     and maybe some pizza     and i could definitely go for some ice cream afterwards     hey
wanna hear a story about ice cream     its about ur favorite kind     mint chocolate chip     so anyways at swimming     (i donno if i ever told you this, but when we win 5 meets, i get a hug    from mrs
gordan
Gordan a hug
well that's not fair, but    this isnt a story about that     so anyways, she also brings her a cup of mint chocolate chip icecream     btw, do you eat icecream when its cold outside
i have a cold, it was cold, and i ate some italian ice, which is right up    the same alley, but not the same, so just wondering     anyways so this icecream becomes the topic of our conversation     basically we have me, blake, and Megan all sitting and streching and Mrs
Gordan eating icecream     Megan: is that icecream
Mrs
Gordan: yeah     Blake: whoa, is that Mint chocolate
Mrs
Gordan: yeah, mint chocolate chip
Megan: Oh my god that is like the single best flavor in the world     Blake: i know really its like my god     Megan: we really need to get like
an icecream shrine to hail Mint    Chocolate chip     Me: yeah, but you know what else is good
silence
they look at me like i'm an infidel to their mint chocolate    chip god     Me: Cookies and cream icecream is like
at very least a close second
a VERY close second     they seem to ignore the comment     Megan: yeah, but Mint Chocolate chip is a god     Blake: its not even a contest, Mint chocolate chip wins hands down     Me: (meekly) its a close CLOSE second           then
things get interesting     Birk: IS THAT ICECREAM
Mrs
Gordan: yeah, too bad you cant have any     SILENCE     Wes: That is so unfair     Birk: Christina, why didn't you bring us any     Christina: because i can only sneak out a little or else i get fired     Wes: so
Christina goes off a bit on how its actually a big deal     Mrs
Gordan: I cant believe this, the one time the entire place is silent    and ur all just listening to us talk about ice cream     it was pretty interesting     you definitely had to have been there to get it
it doesn't seem as    funny when i put it like that

sleepless     Lovers     Invisibility
The thief's guild     Once everyone was all ready, we were assembled into the Lobby
Here we got    into a fine discussion about thieves in Europe
Pickpockets go about,    taking at will
And, seeing as I wish I were that good, we stayed on the    subject of it, and I learned a few things
1) Distraction- I already knew this was a key part, but I didn't really    figure out that it takes more than one
Where Lisa saw these things, they    had two on the sides, bumping the target in a crowded place, while the    third makes the grab
2) Next is the art of the grab
I don't know much about it
but after    they're distracted, you have to balance weight
The key is to have it both    lifted and pulled so that the weight stays the same, but the part you're    screwing with is much
less connected
Lisa was apparently feeling bad or something, and I was trying to steal    things, so I went for a grab
I maneuvered my self behind her and off to    the right
As I hugged her, I said "AWWW POOR LISA
She and I ARE lovers, so I bet she enjoyed it
Well, I    took advantage of her (non-sexually
of course
My hug was low,    around her belly
I slipped my hand to her little blue pouch, tugged on    the zipper, and got it halfway before it got stuck
I had to bail out on    the hug thing
But I stayed right behind her
Eventually, I came back for    it but screwed up
and then she realized what had happened
She didn't    seem to really hate me for it
Bus time: did we watch the replacements
not much happens
but Eva is no longer there
Oh well
started writing last
Change of Perspective
Wednesday 9/2/09     Today, I thought that I had found her
Unfortunately, all I did was stare
Last year, me and Spiros got involved in a conversation about the    possibility of "THE CUTEST ASIAN"
Every now and then, we would proclaim    that we had found her
Today, after Engineering Mech: Dynamics, I went over to the Engineering    building to check out when the Engineering Deans would be in
Right before I got there, this girl walked out of the building
She was    REALLY CUTE
She was the definition of SUPER cute
Height, Hairstyle,    EYES, and walk
The best part: she was dressed in a clean, neat uniform,    complete with a pleated skirt, uniform jacket, and kerchief (thingie
Schoolgirl fetish ftw
I'm pretty sure the most vanilla person would find    it sexy on her
Then again
aren't the tamer ones the most attracted to    the schoolgirl cleanliness
I texted Spiros immediately
His reply was "hahahhahaha"
On the way to the dining hall, I also texted Sasha back: she wanted to    know what classes I had today, and what time
Kairi said hello
When I was swiping into the dining hall, anxious to see if Sasha might    come, I suddenly caught a glance of Cara
And where Cara goes, Hanna is    generally right behind (this sounds wrong
but they're generally always    together in my mind at least)
Shy again
Thinner
Longer hair
Shorter    hair
I don't look at her
I walk
not right anymore
Wanting to call out to Cara for help while she gets a salad
My feet
Inwards
That's interesting
Hanna invites me
I feel myself blush, and I just want to smile
Looking for help
Panic
My left hand nervously grasps at the ends of my shorts
my right    pretends to eat
I don't want to look at her, She doesn't want to look at me
Tension that is tangible
Really awkward topics
Babyfaced Asian B-Boys
Really cute
Oh gee, I gotta go to class
but I REALLY would have much rather been in    this situation for a longer period of time
As I left, I saw her again
or at least one wearing the same uniform
This time, the pleats didn't fold right, giving her silhouette an ugly    shape
Her shirt didn't seem to shine the way it used to
And instead of    the cutie I remember, her face seemed rather
below average
Even the    eyes had lost their shine
Even if it wasn't the same girl, the symbolism is pretty powerful for    something non-fiction
I wish I could get the world to think
So that I don't have to
I wish I could get the world to think
So that we may all see how stupid we've been
I wish I could get the world to think
So that I won't be the only one anymore
sounds like: "Oh god, I'm so    alone")     I wish I could get the world to think
So that they could all see the things I do
Is that how you see the world
As a series of problems
That's a little    sad
Yes, it is
And yet, how often do you see me smile
I think that the only    solutions to the problem of your hypothesis are insanity, falsehood, or a    lie so deep that it has become my outward personality
All of these are    impressive from my perspective, so I suppose I should thank you for the    complement
Is this how the world is to you
Is everything just a problem to be dealt    with
And how about you
Are you simply a problem to me
And if you are, can you    possibly guess what exactly I see from you is a problem
Think about it
And if you are a problem, what has been my solution
Think about that
Why do you use that word so often, when it's clear that you are not    "logical"
GOOD QUESTION
I have come up with only two possible outcomes
Either God is perfect, and we can never know Him
Or He is imperfect, and we can never know this world
Think about how quantum physics seems to defy logical explanation
All of    matter simply exists
It has rules, but they don't seem to work so well as    the macro-scale ones do
It's as if God didn't care about atoms, and left    them to exist as necessary to create larger objects
Either that, or the reason they don't make sense, is because He is a    perfect God, creator of things man can never know
Or, we just need more time
Of course
Why is it that it seems like nobody else pursues things past the initial
And why am I so bad at it, although I do it all the time
There may be too    many thoughts to continue these chains
As I said before, to Spiros (while    Hanna, Chris and Dan were present), You seem to only be able to hold one    main chain, although ghosts appear and split off
And only if you consider    the undercurrents that you notice, but cannot concentrate on as a full    thought, we are limited to at most one and
thoughts simultaneously
I    should look into the thought of using other methods of thinking to    double-think
Sine wave relooping as practice (visual or mental)
Counting    continuously
Watching something while thinking of something else
Using    "walk thoughts" as a second path
Forcing mental split and only following    one chain, then resurfacing the second identity- (could cause madness
but would be really cool)
These things are too hard
I should try them
How about talking to someone while doing difficult tasks
Cooking and    talking
Gaming and talking
What about the use of the undercurrent
It would certainly be valuable to    be able to fully surface the undercurrent, even if I cannot simultaneously    hold it with a main chain
If I actively think my undercurrent, will    another appear
Will a main chain become an undercurrent
Are there    successive layers at all times
Can I reach the LOWEST layer
Another use of the undercurrent: Abuse of love or anger
Use recurring    thought patterns to practice following doubles, instead of bouncing back    and forth between low and high
Other thoughts: does listening to music count as a unique thought
It may    tend to become an undercurrent
Define this in detail, possibly
Also: how far should the pursuit of knowledge go
This is what they mean    by the focus on what you can do, over the focus on what you should do
If    I am curious as to the short and long term personal effects of murder on    myself, and any involved parties, then should I do it
Similarly, if I study madness or thought within myself, should I attempt    to become insane
What about murders of those who are utterly innocent
Murder for sport as    a controlled experiment
Murder of an unrelated subject: will free the    murderer of any uncalled for personal attachment
Also, authority/public    figures will be able to analyze very carefully
An utterly random serial    killer, with an intensely analytical mind
A disruption to the lifelines    that has been inserted completely artificially
A purposeful accident of    grisly nature
Does the life perspective change once this act has been done
Monitor    thoughts from before, during and after
Careful analysis of all writings    and speech patterns
This does not sound like something I could ever do
Not within the    engineering body of knowledge
And madness
I want to inflict madness onto myself, but if I ever do, will    I notice
And what's the difference between becoming insane, and having a    change of heart
If you turn your life around in the wrong direction, is    it really so different
And is aging a form of madness
Culture is the    most common form of insanity
Wisdom is the second most common type
Love    is next
Then addiction
And, do I really seem so arrogant
I just want to assign these things    names
And I want to say that I have thought these things through, and    that for me, my current beliefs are as good as fact
The    implications/connotations of my words and phrasing are informative at    least
I feel as though arrogance is this type of thing, but for the    motive of impressing others
Is informing the same thing as impressing
I suppose that informing someone about how awesome you are is arrogance
And, if I'm informing people about the fact that I've thought about these    things, and reached at least some conclusion is arrogance in that sense
So yes, I am arrogant
When people attack my intelligence, isn't it natural to push them away
For example: I sometimes pull out my high SAT scores, the fact that I have    a ridiculous amount of credits, am getting $13000 a year on academic    scholarships, etc
I'm NOT stupid
i really hate the way you can predict my every thought     i also really hate muluski and gelsinger and dont care how to spell their    names     its good to know you arent a worthless freindless bum without me, proving    you arent an idiot     but, you know what     i would rather you werent so smart because then i wouldnt have to obligate    myself to long essay responses     im just not that kind of person     the suspense is killing me, so do you have school on monday     because i dont and i wanted to visit your house when i get to delaware on    business     too bad if i cant because now that my is supremly cool as compared to    delaware houses that arent big enough to legally have cows, i can but only    2     that part sux     anyway, back to the main subject     i never go to see you house and you promised i could eventually     even though you werent here to see my pathetic loosering, i typed    eventually about 20 times before i got it right     and also all those spainish insults to you back     oo guess what     im starting a new chapter here or at least im going to the student council    meeting to present the idea     hahaha     any way can you send me lots of info because im too lazy to go to the    website     now its time for the eerily creepy prediction     i predict that i will never finish the dilbert future in time to have the    predictions not already come true     its spooky     im afrai
For me, the entire world is structured
But in my own way
Things follow the way that fits me
Perception is reality
Routine
It's a heavy part of this
My life has generally been     The same since day one
You go to school, you have school
You go home
And then you come back the next day
Deviations from this were only ever if I routinely went somewhere else,     Or if I suddenly found something more interesting to do
Plans were only made as an appointment to a collective that made decisions    for me
I was, and I am, a robot
A slave to a system
I generally hate taking calls from Abby
It goes against my entire normal world
It's utterly alien
It seems odd to be such close friends to someone     Without a declared grouping
Without a stated structure
Without rules
It scares me
My choices: discomfort     Alienation     Change     Avoidance     Lying     Scaring her off     Blowing her off     Running out of time     At least I sort of told her that friendship is an alien concept
Not really, but if I said it flatly, she would remember a lot of evidence
It's one of those things
Then again, she's a very smart girl
She'd probably be able to put it into    words without prompting
Lunch

Racism vs
Stupidity     If a man gets fired for being black, and he can prove it, lets all hope he    wins in courts
I'm under the impression that every now and then he will lose, and that    could probably be fixed
If a man gets fired for being stupid, and he can prove it, lets all hope    he loses in courts, and gets laughed at long and hard
I'm under the impression that every now and then he will lose, and that    could probably be fixed
Go ahead read the last sentence again
Stupid people win in courts a lot of times, and it makes life miserable    for all of us
I knew of this one time, it really made everyone unhappy,    and odds are it made the whiny idiot fairly well off
A steak house chain called "Lone Star" was a very nice restaurant
They    used to have buckets and buckets of peanuts as a sort of appetizer
You    came in, sat down, and chomped on the peanuts until either you ran out, or    your food came
The greatest part is that you just threw the peanut shells    wherever you pleased and nobody really cared
Then one day some whiny little fool slipped and fell on a shell
I bet he    was having a really bad day, and this rather inconvienced them, as they    were probably hurt bad enough from the fall that they sued Lone Star and    from that day forth the peanuts were no more
I found a peanut shell some years later at the restaurant, but I sucked it    up
I didn't sue anyone
Anyways, though we're all rooting for equality and fairness and whatnot,    we have to take into account some people are either A) making excuses for    doing a crappy job, or B) just stupid and whiny
Of course might be some    racism going on, but I don't really have anything mean to say about that    besides that someone should fix it
Another fine example, especially if you get a nice mental picture, of the    thin line between racism and stupidity is involving a New York group that    demanded absolute equality
Actually, if you want to get all picky and    stupid, it was an example of the thin line between genderism and    stupidity
A woman's group in New York was pushing for complete and total equality
This was all fine and good until an interesting topic came up
It was on    the matter of seeking physical fitness and the appropriateness of the    clothing thereof
This is what I THINK happened, in my opinion and interpretation of the    events
An attractive young member of the group saw a bunch of hot guys jogging    and casually eyed them
The guys noticed this fine young woman eyed her    back they had a fine moment
At the group's meeting that night she was    daydreaming of the hot jogger fellow(s) and when prompted for an idea, she    mentioned the first thing that came to mind
Hot, sweaty manflesh,    shirtless on the hot summer day
Another member, immediately grabbed at the thought and soon after the    group was brought to court for exercising (PUN get it
They claimed that it was only fair because guys get    to do it
Now, is that stupid or progress
Made of Ice     (There's a person I knew
A person, who pushed me out of her life over    this weird little experience that was basically a huge misunderstanding
She was incredibly beautiful
Now I see her every now and then, and we    don't even say hi
If I say something to her, I know she'll respond, but I    feel like because she threw me out of her life, if I tried to come back,    it would be rude or something
And so, I feel like an outsider: seeing how    incredibly beautiful she is, but unable to reach out to her
Conclusion:    its my fault
She was made of    ice
Everything about her was a cool, composed elegance
She carried    herself like a queen; her back straight and dignified, as if she were    under the scrutiny of the highest ministers and the royal family from the    day she was born
Her face was calmly placed on the rigid pedestal of    pride, or more like a frozen sculpture that would continue to smile    sweetly even if removed from the chilled structure of her body
Every hair    looked as if it were carved deliberately from a glacier, and shined and    shimmered, catching light as if God himself had molded her every feature
She was never cold, dressing lightly in white to match the frost
As she    entered a room, a blast of cold turned every boy's head
Her body was thin    and slender, almost as if she were a dancer made with icicles
Her long    arms and legs had a natural grace, and her every move seemed as beautiful    as snowfall
The pale details of her face seemed like a translucent fac,ade, shining    and beautiful, but empty
So perfect was she, that sometimes it forced me    to ask whether she was even human
Why was she a cold crystal, when the    rest of us were taken from clay
She's made of ice
A clean, perfect sculpture of the purest snow, carved    by the most skilled hands
Is it just my imagination
I'm sure she's as    beautiful
And as cold
Is she as fragile
Will one touch break her pure,    crystal structure
Will one drop of impurity sully her completely
She once told me to never even speak to her again
All the time we've    avoided each other, the only acknowledgment of the other was a cold    glance
Now that ice begins to thaw
Today, we spoke
Quitely
Coldly
Distantly
Briefly
And yes, Awkwardly
As I looked at her, she seemed to melt before my eyes
Her face was tired
The smooth, cold eyes that were once so alive and attractive were now dull    and extinguished
They were just eyes, not a shining diamond embedded an    ice sculpture
I discovered I was the one made of ice
Cold, distant, I shied away to    protect my delicate ice body
I was afraid the fragile ice would melt by    her anger, even a casual touch
Just one drop would contaminate the pure    ice, and I would be irreversibly dirtied
I turned away, and felt my blood freeze
Does this get my message across
Any imagery that's particularly ineffective/stupid
TOO repetitive
That's pretty much the point, but there's also a line I    shouldn't cross
I don't think I really like it as it is
Absolute original:     When I thought of her, that's all I could think of
She was made of ice
Everything about her was a cool, composed elegance
She carried herself    like a queen, her back straight and dignified
Her face was calmly placed    on the rigid pedestal of pride
Each hair looked as if it were carved    deliberately from a glacier, and shined and shimmered, catching light as    if God Himself had moulded her every feature
She was never cold, but rather chilled the room with her permanent calm
Even when she smiled, it seemed like an artist had carved every tooth from    the frozen body
The pale details of her face seemed like a translucent fac,ade, shining    and beautiful, but empty
Why was she the cold crystal she was
Is it just my imagination
Do I    feel, somehow, that she's as fragile and cold as ice
Is she just as    beautiful and untouchable as a frozen sculpture
She's made of ice
Just one touch would break her pure, crystal structure
Just a drop of impurity would completely sully her
After all this time, I'm forced to ignore her, the ice is beginning to    thaw
We looked at each other today
And I discovered I was the one made of ice
Cold, distant, I was unwilling to reach out to her for fear that my    fragile body would be broken by her heated anger
She told me to never look at her again, and today I did
I discovered her    face tired, her features seemed to sag and melt before my eyes
The    smooth, cold eyes, once so beautiful and shining, seemed dull and    extinguished
In an    instant we had reversed, and I would be the one to shun her
She would    look at me from this moment on as someone filled with cool anger, a frosty    hate, and utter uncaring
Original: I ask REALLY dumb questions
I use too many un-original phrases (frozen soul
gee, that's not a    cliche)     a lot of the imagery isn't too well developed
I tried to fix that in    the other one
not deep enough overall
it gives exactly the outline I wanted: a solid base
but needs more     New: it doesn't stay exactly true to my original thoughts
However, when it strays, its because I was following a part of the imagery    I wanted to build- frozen, icy- but beautiful
Also, the dumb questions aren't as bad (I think) and actually lead    somewhere (I think
Confessions     These are my confessions     They are my loves     They cannot be denied     There is proof in them     They cannot be told     These are the highest truths in my mind     1
there is no such thing as a perfect truth     with this comes the realization that you cannot firmly deny anything, nor    give absolute proof     2
there is no perfect conveyance of ideas     with perfection will come a blatant lack of free will, impossible from any    perspective
Confessions are only half told in greatest detail, and more conveyed as    simpler     Things cannot just be told     3
there is no wrongs in any logic     or else there is no logic     flaws in logic are self-contradictory, and prove to be true if false     breaks in explinations are that, not flaws in logic     4
a lie is a lie, is a lie     or there is no way to tell truth     any perfections are lies     any lies are undeniably false, even when proven true     all true lies can be misinterpreted as truth     5
stop reading you dumb person, go away     6
I cant believe you fell for that crap, so bad     7
Would you PLEASE stop reading my stuff OMG

Im serious, don't go through it anymore     9

a big fuzzy tail    Jeffrey63090 [9:20 PM]:   that wags    Jeffrey63090 [9:20 PM]:   and can be a third arm    Hybridshiek [9:20 PM]:   you're not telling the truth    Hybridshiek [9:20 PM]:   but you don't have to    Hybridshiek [9:20 PM]:   your business    Jeffrey63090 [9:20 PM]:
i dont think it ever works    Jeffrey63090 [9:21 PM]:   they just usually give me a funny look and drop    it    Hybridshiek [9:21 PM]:   well    Hybridshiek [9:21 PM]:   I'll pursue the subject if you want me to    Jeffrey63090 [9:21 PM]:   well, i dont
want people to know much    Jeffrey63090 [9:21 PM]:   lots simpler that way    Jeffrey63090 [9:21 PM]:   only let them skin deep    Hybridshiek [9:22 PM]:   hm    Jeffrey63090 [9:22 PM]:   plus
then when they break the skin- it looks    like you have a lot more in you    Hybridshiek [9:22 PM]:   but you do    Hybridshiek [9:22 PM]:   and you intrigue me    Jeffrey63090 [9:22 PM]:   its like
MIND CONTROL    Jeffrey63090 [9:22 PM]:   its like people dont immediately see the    solution to magic tricks    Jeffrey63090 [9:22 PM]:   because they WANT to believe    Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   especially if you believe in magic too    Hybridshiek [9:24 PM]:   I wish I could    Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   could see the tricks behind magic
Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   or believe
Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh    Hybridshiek [9:24 PM]:   could believe in it    Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   pulling the philosophy shit all over
Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   ahhhhhhhhhhh    Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   make it go away    Hybridshiek [9:24 PM]:   um
sorry
Hybridshiek [9:24 PM]:   but you know    Jeffrey63090 [9:24 PM]:   nothign    Hybridshiek [9:24 PM]:   magic would make life interesting    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   but imagine magical WARS    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   its like
flying people    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   and big kabooies    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   ka
blooies    Jeffrey63090 [9:25 PM]:   and basically worse than right now    Hybridshiek [9:25 PM]:   exactly    Hybridshiek [9:25 PM]:   it would be cool    Jeffrey63090 [9:26 PM]:   it would be cool to watch    Jeffrey63090 [9:26 PM]:   not live    Hybridshiek [9:26 PM]:   if we have to have wars    Hybridshiek [9:26 PM]:   then they would be cooler with magic    Jeffrey63090 [9:26 PM]:   i think not
Jeffrey63090 [9:26 PM]:   unles
your the only one with magic    Hybridshiek [9:26 PM]:   yeah    Jeffrey63090 [9:26 PM]:   then you would be INVINCIBLE    Hybridshiek [9:26 PM]:   dictatorshi[    Hybridshiek [9:26 PM]:   *ship    Hybridshiek [9:27 PM]:   well I guess magic does exist in ways    Jeffrey63090 [9:27 PM]:   or
just be a hermit and live in some magical    forest    Jeffrey63090 [9:27 PM]:   much better than blowing things up everywhere    Hybridshiek [9:27 PM]:   lol    Hybridshiek [9:27 PM]:   magic does exist    Hybridshiek [9:27 PM]:   well    Hybridshiek [9:27 PM]:   it depends on your opinion    Hybridshiek [9:27 PM]:   of magic    Hybridshiek [9:27 PM]:   is magic all spells
Jeffrey63090 [9:27 PM]:   its
not fair
thats what im always thinking    Hybridshiek [9:28 PM]:   or is it simply the world around us
Jeffrey63090 [9:28 PM]:   well
not always    Jeffrey63090 [9:28 PM]:   but sometimes    Jeffrey63090 [9:28 PM]:   (yes yes
dual meanings)    Hybridshiek [9:28 PM]:   no    Jeffrey63090 [9:28 PM]:   (all intended)    Hybridshiek [9:28 PM]:   magic is watching a shooting star    Hybridshiek [9:28 PM]:   or falling in love    Jeffrey63090 [9:28 PM]:   shooting stars arent magical    Hybridshiek [9:28 PM]:   or acing a test in a boring subject    Hybridshiek [9:29 PM]:   of course they are    Jeffrey63090 [9:29 PM]:   no they arent    Jeffrey63090 [9:29 PM]:   they're not even all that pretty    Hybridshiek [9:29 PM]:   yes they are    Hybridshiek [9:29 PM]:   okay fine different example    Hybridshiek [9:29 PM]:   nature    Jeffrey63090 [9:29 PM]:   they only last the tiniest bit of a second
theres no enjoying it    Hybridshiek [9:29 PM]:   you can view anything as logical or as magical    Hybridshiek [9:30 PM]:   it's your own opiniob    Hybridshiek [9:30 PM]:   *opinion    Jeffrey63090 [9:30 PM]:   i think everyone has at one point or another    kind of fleshed this out     Hybridshiek [9:30 PM]:   mmhmm    Jeffrey63090 [9:30 PM]:   but theres no bones HAHAHA    Jeffrey63090 [9:30 PM]:   ok    Hybridshiek [9:30 PM]:
Jeffrey63090 [9:31 PM]:   is it wrong to write love letters on paper thats    not yours    Jeffrey63090 [9:31 PM]:   lol    Jeffrey63090 [9:31 PM]:   its an interesting thought    Hybridshiek [9:31 PM]:   hm    Hybridshiek [9:31 PM]:   no    Jeffrey63090 [9:32 PM]:   thats like using someone elses bathroom, and    getting it clogged    Jeffrey63090 [9:32 PM]:   no- not an interesting thought    Jeffrey63090 [9:32 PM]:   no- you cant do it
Hybridshiek [9:32 PM]:   I think    Hybridshiek [9:32 PM]:   it's not wrong to do so    Hybridshiek [9:32 PM]:   if they give you permission    Jeffrey63090 [9:32 PM]:   what if you're giving the letter to the same    person you took the paper FROM    Jeffrey63090 [9:32 PM]:   whoa
Hybridshiek [9:33 PM]:   hm    Hybridshiek [9:33 PM]:   then they can erase it    Hybridshiek [9:33 PM]:   or throw it away    Jeffrey63090 [9:33 PM]:   lol    Hybridshiek [9:33 PM]:   and plant a tree    Jeffrey63090 [9:33 PM]:   yeah, but if they like you, then its like
2x    the sentimental value    Jeffrey63090 [9:33 PM]:   i cherished this paper so much that i gave it    back to you    Jeffrey63090 [9:33 PM]:   to remember me by    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   because with only you can i write these    beautiful words    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   lol    Hybridshiek [9:34 PM]:   aww    Hybridshiek [9:34 PM]:   that's cute
Favorite look     5/3/09     My favorite look on a person is when someone is saying something very    serious, something they feel very saddened about, but they do it with    traces of a smile on their face
Things like when I was talking to Elaine's friends
They told me "you guys    would make a cute couple" and I said "I think she would be cute with    anyone
It has the deepest kind of truth there is
Simultaneously, you feel the sadness, the wish it could be changed, and    the knowledge that it cannot
In some cases, you can also feel the sense that everything is moving    towards a point of intentional self-destruction
It seems like only yesterday     When you'd smile and play     And we'd talk of pants and things     And our words weren't bee stings     We borrowed Amanda's lotion     But since I got that dumb notion     (to touch and say "I'm GAY"
that was such a bad day)     I'm so sad that those days are in the past,     Now my friendship boat has a broken mast
I might've been on dope,     Now I'm going to mope
I'm sorry for
um
If you stay mad at me
I'll eat a goat
On Charisma and being a spy
the one who is quietly skilled, great in    academics, but always overlooked
Someone like that would long for the    power, retribution, and acknowledgement granted by joining a great    underground network
Someone who's skill is recognized by dark forces,    someone who is all too happy to trade their morality for power and    recognition
And when they're caught by Bond, oh how they writhe
They're    no match physically, they run from him, they're caught, they struggle, and    they lose
And when they're held up by the neck, they spit in his face
They blame him
People like him, who steal the spotlight
People that have    no idea
Such anger
Such righteous anger
And as they die, though they    writhed and are shown as pathetic
they call it a good death
To have    chosen this life was a great honor
And to die for it, is only right
And    in the end, the power and promise was still greater than the price paid
Though they are called pathetic, they are right, angry, and defiant
To blend in, wouldn't it be best to have the quietly skilled, easily    overlooked people
Or, after all, is it best to have the flamboyant, but    charismatic people
People who are so attractive that others will let    consider the inevitable betrayal a fair price for their company
It seems that Erik Bradley was right: there's probably the two kinds
But    they only make movies about Bond
There's the good spies: the ones    undercover, blending in
The informants that are most often seen in dire    need of saving
The ones who are most often seen dead in some photograph,    prompting action by the agency
But then, of course, there has to be a Bond, the a-hole
The    credit-stealing, showboating, very visible face of the agency
And is that the reason why there are so often dark intelligencia
Because    they had to find their own way through the dark, once they turn away from    the beaming, credit-stealing beacon that is Bond
And in the dark they    find anger
In the dark they find furtive, dirty ways to get ahead
And    they emerge powerful, recognized, and covered in blood and dirt
And when Bond gets to them
they seem almost pathetic in comparison
They're the perfect antagonists, if you only have the view of Bond
When they're caught, the squeal and snivel and run
But if you could cut    through the fear, you'll see anger
You'll see the frustration of being    foiled by this Dick
This credit-stealing asshole
To know that they've    only come full circle in some sick joke
The would say, deep in their hearts "I've always wondered
why do scum    like you always get to play hero
soil my very soul, to reach what I wanted
and    you get to claim God on your side
My path was one of infinitely more    sadness, one of such incredible suffering
And you had life handed to you    on a silver platter
Maybe this is Why there are so many sniveling henchmen types
The skilled    and uncharismatic
The ones that chose what they see as morally right
They'd do anything to reach the next level
the level that they    rightfully deserve, but are denied
And so they choose to suck up to some    inferior brat, rather than topple him by force
And they are never seen as anything more than yes-men
It's because the most obviously skilled are promoted, rather than the ones    that actually are most skilled
If you see the talent radiating from a    Bond, you would promote him
If you're not seen being skilled, the talent    will waste
9/12/09     Jeffrey     hi     12:18amOwen     greetings     12:18amJeffrey     yo     12:20amJeffrey     hey, i have a great idea     lets all flirt on your wall

12:25amOwen     no I do     12:25amJeffrey     o ok     12:25amOwen     but I'd rather cry about it     12:25amJeffrey     lol     i know the feeling
geez that
i should stop being so comfortable around you     because then when i talk to you online, i will be even more comfortable    with you     and say stuff that should never be said exactly
12:26amOwen     oh but it should     and I will laugh and laugh and laugh     and maybe learn something     12:26amJeffrey     that
if you were a girl, that would turn me on so much     that's probably the best way to put it     are you talkign to tessa too
btw, fb does not log chats     12:27amOwen     por supuesto     si, eso yo aprendido     *he aprendido     12:28amJeffrey
12:28amOwen     I wish it did     12:28amJeffrey     me 2     wait
you're talking to tessa
12:28amOwen     si     12:28amJeffrey     damn it
12:28amOwen
por que
12:29amJeffrey     she didn't message me     12:29amOwen     you mean first, or at all
12:29amJeffrey     at all     well     after i messaged her     she responded     12:29amOwen     yes, same     12:29amJeffrey     o     12:29amOwen     that's usually how conversations start     one person says something, and then the other says something back     12:30amJeffrey     yes     12:30amOwen     otherwise it's just one-sided     and that sucks     12:30amJeffrey     but you hope they want to talk to you     and its NOT one sided     see
12:30amOwen     of course, that's always nice     but someone always must talk first     I wouldn't dwell on it     12:30amJeffrey     well     it's closely related to     12:30amOwen     now what you should do is write a program to keep stats and judge relative    interest     12:30amJeffrey     this
I say to myself    "my phone isn't ringing
nobody must want to talk to me
Just because you aren't getting a call doesn't mean    that nobody wants to talk to you
That's what I tell myself at night to make me feel better about being    shy
Everyone    must feel like this
That's how I feel
12:31amOwen     ok     12:33amJeffrey     i like stats     but i don't like work     the only solution     is to get you to do it for me     because i like games     on a side note, is it BAD to refer to someone mentally as "my new favorite    plaything"     because i consider it a very bad indicator     very "red flag"     12:34amOwen     it's not so much bad as a bad sign     12:34amJeffrey     ah
so we're in agreement     12:34amOwen     and let me guess who that is     12:35amJeffrey     ok     i will     12:36amOwen     no that wasn't a request     it identifies that I think that the answer is obvious     12:36amJeffrey     yes     and my statements were an invitation     12:37amOwen     AR     12:37amJeffrey     to a sarcastic declaration of a few false people
or you could go straight for the kill     that too     12:40amOwen     man you obsessing over AR is really tough     12:41amJeffrey     why
12:42amOwen     well     I still have stories     12:42amJeffrey     no wa
i should
finish reading through them     12:43amOwen     haha     12:55amJeffrey     hey     for vex     stick me on the mailing list please
also, do i need to read anything     for wednesday     which i don't know the meeting time/ place of     12:56amOwen     um, give me some time to think about that     and
you could read the rules, that would be good     12:56amJeffrey     where is that
12:56amOwen     um, I'll get back to you on that     I'm busy reproducing you     AR is fascinated by you     12:57amJeffrey     i'll give you a hint     formal language is good for controlling anger     which is the opposite of her     where she totally loses her cool     fascinating
12:57amOwen     what
12:58amJeffrey     also, for hiding fear, righteousness and fighting off rejection     she uses less proper notation more when she feels emotion     at least i think     i'm pretty sure that i use logic as a crutch when emotionally attacked     it's not fair for me to analyze it myself though     also, because i recieve less cues of emotional response over the internet     my correlations on her use of capitalization and informal language to    emotion     could be 100% off     the case where it is significantly off implies two things: that she    doesn't care about me, or that she lacks feelings in general     because these are "unthinkable cases" they are discounted for uselessness     for example: if a meteor were to be on a collision course with Earth     you wouldn't have a FEMA response ready for the scenario where there is a    direct hit that wipes out all of North America
is this
a correct way of thinking
or is there a lot that can still be done if she is completely uncaring
i guess
if she were, then a total rejection of any feelings i display    toward her would be complete non-factors on her side     so that simplifies everything to a great degree     although for people who strongly feel annoyance, then a rejection would    result in complete failure of any friendship     Owen     bye jeff
you're talking to Owen and not me
12:29amTessa     heehee     12:29amJeffrey     you're mean
12:29amTessa     nto in particular     12:30amJeffrey     aww, here i was, hoping i'd get special treatment     12:30amTessa     nope     12:31amJeffrey     sooooooo     tessa
how was your day
12:32amTessa     it was okay
i was really hungover for a lot of it     i hung out with a friend who i hadn't seen in a while, so that was nice     12:32amJeffrey     friends are good
12:33amTessa     indeed     12:37amJeffrey     Hi Tessa
12:38amTessa     I think I'm going to start limiting the number of times you can say hi to    me     12:38amJeffrey     damn it     12:38amTessa     To, like, once per sonversation     conversation*     12:39amJeffrey     well, what should i do when that thought fills up my entire head
fake something else
Also, this limit will lead to me not saying hello to you, and instead just    jumping awkwardly into conversation without a conventional opener     so i can save my hello for later
12:40amTessa     you are SO odd     12:41amJeffrey     i'm pretty sure that this is the only logical solution that takes into    account both your rules, and my personality, both of which i have no    control over     12:42amTessa     My rules
12:42amJeffrey     one hello per conversation     12:42amTessa     Ah     12:43amJeffrey     i can think of many other alternatives which might be preferable     the one that is conventionally used is that every time i say hello again,    you sort of sigh and comment on the strangeness of it     and it becomes a regular thing between us     and is therefore easily ignorable     unless it is really abrasive     12:44amTessa     somewhat, yes     12:44amJeffrey     in which case it will never become more or less ignorable     so the option there would probably
be to hate me forever    and tell me to get lost
can't find a good one right now     12:44amTessa     But I may increasingly want to avoid being near you, as well as possibly    wanting to hurt you     12:45amJeffrey     hmmmm     i don't want either of those outcomes     12:45amTessa     No, no you don't     12:46amJeffrey     how about
you give me an example of what to do as a workaround to my    tendency to want to say hello to someone multiple times, especially when    there has been a break in conversation     12:47amTessa     you could bring up a subject of interest to discuss     12:47amJeffrey     ok
what about if only one thought is in your mind at the time
and remains    so for a long period of time     for example "hi tessa" filling up the entire space     12:48amTessa     why the fuck would that ever happen
12:48amJeffrey     geez, you're so angry     12:49amJeffrey     also, to answer the question, we don't know why this happens, only that it    does and that i have to deal with it     my previous workaround was to say "hmmmm" loudly, but then people objected    to that as well     12:51amTessa     sometimes silence is perfectly acceptable, you know     12:51amJeffrey     acceptable, but not really preferred, right
but i guess for you it's preferrable to "hello"     12:52amTessa     Yes     Very much so     12:52amJeffrey     i'll try that then     12:52amTessa     Good     12:53amJeffrey     what are you up to right now
12:54amTessa     trying to memorize shit     12:54amJeffrey     o, have fun     12:54amTessa     oh, i'm loving it     Jeffrey     bye Tessa
1:06amTessa     laters     1:06amJeffrey     actually, i lied     it's more accurate to say     bye tessa
did you just call
2:08amJeffrey     yes, well, it can be ON while charging     2:08amOwen     oh right     2:08amJeffrey     i called like 40 minutes ago     2:08amOwen     oh     how about that     sorry     I'll do better next time     2:09amJeffrey     stop that     2:09amOwen     I will though     2:09amJeffrey     also, y are you not on g-chat     2:09amOwen     I suppose it's a bit late though     this is true     I would have to switch windows     would be slow     2:10amJeffrey     but it would prevent me from having to come onto facebook to yell at you     2:10amOwen     this is true     in general, I prefer g-chat becasue fewer people can talk to me     but now I'm talking to Tessa     2:11amJeffrey     do you ever feel like you're coming back to your old life because you    haven't found anything else
and what should you do if you find something else that is very obviously    not healthy
you should be on both, ESPECIALLY if g-chat fewer people talk to you     2:12amOwen     OK
2:12amJeffrey     because that mitigates the worry that you have to actually switch back and    forth     2:13amOwen     um, I can't switch back and forth if i only have on window open     2:13amJeffrey
you're on your windows-looking thing, right
firefox has tabbed browsing
2:14amOwen     yes     but facebook is resource hog     2:15amJeffrey     oh     2:16amOwen     you are feeling strong emotions today     2:16amJeffrey     yes     anger, in particular     sorry     2:17amOwen     angry at me
2:17amJeffrey     no, just in general
2:18amOwen     so     you were talking about using logic when you're defensive     2:19amJeffrey     i remember once that I wanted to talk to Sasha about something once     and i saw her on fb     so i said hello     and introduced an interesting idea that would work better with pictures     2:19amOwen     oh great so     2:19amJeffrey     so i asked if i could come over, since neither of us were doing anything     (this is going somewhere, i promis)     2:20amOwen     you're making me feel even worse for turning off my phone     2:20amJeffrey
o     sorry     i don't get it
2:20amOwen     because it's the same thing today     except you couldn't come over     2:20amJeffrey     no, this is about the logic thing     2:20amOwen     because my phone was off     so it's all my fault     OK I'mdone go on     2:21amJeffrey     stop that, you're acting like me     anyway     geez     GEeezzzzseeeaes     anyway     so she said "no"     "stop that sketchy shit"     2:21amOwen     awww     2:22amJeffrey     yes, but to that i paused for about a minute     and, after a long time     i could only say     "I do not see anything wrong with wanting to see a friend in person"     "but if that is how you feel, then I will not"     goodbye Sasha     and i signed off and left to do something else     later on she texted me saying sorry     and when i got back to my comp, there was a reply still in chat     saying basically "wait, you're just being stupid"     that's the first time i remember thinking without contractions, every word    being heavy     and formal     and there was nothing but pain and anger     so, now i notice it     and sometimes encourage it     2:25amOwen     was this since she came to RUL     2:25amJeffrey     tessa seems to drop capitalization and contraction more when emotionally    stirred, by contrast     2:25amOwen     *RU
2:25amJeffrey     no this was her sr
year i think     possibly the first day of spring     2:26amOwen     so like, you were angry because she was sarcastic and mean
2:28amJeffrey     no, she was serious and actually meant it     2:29amOwen     she actually thought that was sketchy
2:29amJeffrey     yes, of course it was     2:29amOwen     maybe I'm too tired to think clearly     was it late
2:29amJeffrey     no     afternoon     2:30amOwen     so
I'm afraid I don't understand     why is that sketchy
2:30amJeffrey     because an excited guy wants to come over to talk in person, when there is    nobody at her place, and the guy is me     2:31amOwen     I guess it would depend on how well you know each other     if you've been friends awhile I don't think it's mad sketch     oh, question
You called "that she doesn't care about me, or that she    lacks feelings in general" "unthinkable cases"     can you explain
2:32amJeffrey     if those are the actual situations     then there is no amount of planning that will change the outcome     except in a direction that is considered "failure"     2:33amOwen     is the following an accurate characterization of your behavior:     you try to infect as many people as possible with your ideas, in the hope    that some of them will take to it     2:34amJeffrey     yes     especially to Dan Malzone the pharmacist     and boring thinking people who have potential     2:34amOwen     now the question is, sometimes is one person more important than just    adding to the "readership", if you will     2:35amJeffrey     yes     if nothing else, because there will always be a star pupil     but more specifically, other factors     such as being a cute girl/possible partner     possible "the one" ness     etc     best friend material     people i feel abnormally comfortable around     interesting people     2:36amOwen     so it's more than scientific     it's personal     though I suppose science can be personal     2:37amJeffrey     people don't get into science if it's not personal     mindreader freak     geez     well     i guess they might     a lot probably do     that sucks     2:37amOwen     yeah     maybe they don't stick with it     2:38amJeffrey     btw, the picturesforsadchildren was kind of like that     it explores the possiblity of everything cool actually sucking     like engineering filled with fratboys i'd rather not talk to     well, not filled     but there's a lot     maybe i'm being too shallow towards them     2:39amOwen     I
learned to appreciate them last year     but i still love my suitemates the best     2:40amJeffrey     appreciate them how
2:40amOwen     they're nice, they're easy to talk to, they say funny things     not people I could connect with     but people it doesn't hurt to eavesdrop on     2:41amJeffrey     so
no different than the teeming masses of people you don't know
is that too harsh
2:41amOwen     basically     my opinion of the teeming masses various     *varies     sometimes I hate them     today I'm feeling happy, so I love them     ask me some other time and you'll get a very different story     2:42amJeffrey     hopefully there's at least a few Elise's among them
that might not make    sense     2:42amOwen     there's Elise's among everyone     2:43amJeffrey     also, i'm sure there's a lot of Luke's among them
so they're good for    experiments and studying     if i feel like being an asshole     (which i do
2:46amOwen     I think that really varies     2:46amJeffrey     maybe
he seems cool with non-christians     2:47amJeffrey     he can't be considered religious anymore     cognitive dissonance ownzed him     2:47amOwen     no one in my suite gets righteous about god     or religion     or other beliefes     *beliefs     in fact     I don't know too many people who do     I know people who get righteous about non-religious things     2:48amJeffrey     *ahem
2:48amOwen
2:48amJeffrey     (is it me
2:48amJeffrey     yes     2:48amOwen     how is that cute
2:48amJeffrey     donno     2:49amOwen     most people are not thinking about you right now     2:49amJeffrey     probably because of its sharp contrast to the phrase "i was thinking of    you
2:51amJeffrey     or
sleep     lol     2:51amOwen     hey that is a good idea     2:51amJeffrey     no way
let's quickly copy-paste this chat     2:51amOwen     I already did     2:51amJeffrey     so we can later analyze it     2:52amOwen     I'll have my phone on tomorrow     you can come over or not, as you see fit     2:53amJeffrey     ah     great     although it might be time for me to try not to fail     ALL of my classes     2:53amOwen     actually, that's a good point     I bet if you spend some serious time studying you'll feel better     2:54amJeffrey     or worse     but at least the pain could possibly be productive for once     gj everyone     i'm sure we all did something emotionally or physically beneficial today     2:55amOwen     I sure did     2:55amJeffrey     let's call it a night     2:55amOwen     sweet dreams     On Owen's conversation with Tessa
Of course I want to know
Don't be ridiculous
But I'm going to try not to    ask
Part of it is that I'm not sure if he'll tell, and that I don't want to    know
And also that I'm afraid of the possibility that the outlook is    bleak
But a BIG part of it is what I jotted down before going to bed
Maybe emotional breakdown/insanity will be good for me
After reading the transcript, or    getting a summary from him, I would be silent, unreadable
And then, it    would settle as this: the knowledge he just gave me was the final blow on    the fragile shell of sanity that was already threatened by the events    earlier in the day/week
My mind would shatter, or my heart would shatter, and I would be forever    changed
This is what I hoped for, and I was willing to wait until the right    opportunity to use this devastating information
I am lying in wait,    prepared to spring a fatal trap on myself
Relationships (re-titled Real-ationships) Tuesday January 22, 2008     "SO
Who's the girl
I hadn't heard the whole question
The Princeton Swimmers were a    pretty loud group, singing "rock you like a hurricane" and "sandstorm"    alternately
I couldn't honestly answer yes or no
I only stopped for a second, before putting on my jacket, thinking about    how much my head hurt (dehydration) and tossing my bag on my shoulder
I think he started saying something, but I walked out the door, up the    stairs and to where my parents were waiting
My legs were tired, and my    voice was nearly gone
I was about to gently touch my father's hand when    he turned and noticed me
I was going to grab the flowers and balloons from them
Make their lives    easier
After all, they were mine, why should they have to carry them
As we went out, they asked me about Sarah
I answered directly on their    issues of groping, girlfriends, history, and cameras
We talked about the meet once we were in the car
Elevate your legs
they'll feel better
I fell awkwardly to the ground behind the couch, after moving the guitar    hero controllers from the area
Listening to Mogwai quietly question life,    and trying to read As I Lay Dying, my mind drifted back to Jaworsky's    question
In my mind I was in the library, talking to Marissa
The more I think about it, the more I change
The more I    change, the more I see that you've changed
But, "The more I change, the less I know
Pretty soon I'll be so different    from the way that I was
As if    she were a part of me that I needed to be whole
Or if she were a relic of    the way I used to be; If just by holding her I would immediately remember    my entire past, and be able to return to the way I was
I shake my inner    head and continue
that the next time
I'll still have    no idea how to do things right
Will I ruin things
all
over
again
The thoughts pass slowly over my mind
They    stream slowly by now, and I clench at my heart to bring me back to    reality
It's time to go
I don't have time for this
I say it to myself
I never believe it, and though it's always true, it's    always such bullshit
Which is worth more
It's easiest if you imagine your heart as the center of both selves
or    if you picture both bodies tied by chains around the arms
All you have to    do is focus, and bring yourself back in sync
Jamie asked me to be more positive after I showed her my lit mag    submissions
I told her that it was so much easier to provoke sad feelings, create    desolate images, and be emo, than to empower the reader, inspire hope, and    be positive
Yes, but much more beautiful than funny, I think
You asked me to be more positive
So, I got to thinking, what were the greatest things that have ever    happened to me
Later on I started asking around
I discovered most of us don't have a    happy memory floating around on the surface of our minds
I think I only    came across like 3 people who had one immediately
They were all sort of    abstract feelings
The sort of thing I was looking for myself
A general    sense of everything being right at one time or another
Here's what we have
Please don't share this with anyone
Watching movies with friends, all of us crammed onto one couch, under one    blanket
Abby's movie nights (even though she's only invited me to like 2
While other people do a lot of weird stuff, I sort of    hang on the couch and eat the food
And bother the people who I'm    practically sitting on (it gets pretty tight
But not awkward
SOME people
don't like holding hands
I find it hard to see how they'll    survive
Holding hands and linking arms are like
looking at the moon or    seeing the ocean
They're completely natural and necessary parts of life
Huggy
The secret: when you run through a puddle,    purposefully stomp as hard as possible and splash everyone around you
Then go into first place so you can pick what ground you want to run on
When I finished, Rosie said that I ran so well, I deserved a hug
She was    wearing a black fleece sweatshirt, and it was a sunny day
Hugging her was    like squeezing a beautifully warm, soft fuzzball
I was completely    enveloped with the warmth, and I felt like I would die if I were any    happier
The whole day I was floating on a cloud
About an hour later, she asked me    why I was still smiling
Huggy
When your parents say something really dirty
My parents are getting    really bad now that I'm the only one left
When you're not sure if someone likes you, but they're phenomenally cute    and you make a fool of yourself
This happens to me too often to count
It's a lot more fun that way
And, it's pretty much completely    unstoppable
Like, even if I'm just sort of sitting there minding my own    business, when someone cute comes by, somehow I'll screw something up or    cause a commotion
Its ridiculous
She's seen me lose my mind over the    years I've know her
And over the past few months, I've been kind of    losing it
One day, after going into a weird rant, then hysterics, I gave    up on trying to explain what I was saying, and everyone breathed a sigh of    relief- happy I ended my madman rant
Amanda's also really hot
After the intense frustration of knowing exactly    what I mean, and knowing that everyone else thinks I'm crazy, hearing her    say this really hit something
It was like she really cared about me
It    was like she wanted me to be better, because when I'm better, everything    is better
Its like what everyone else always says: "If Jeff is depressed,    we KNOW something's wrong
That's kind of cute
There was time    when I thought that the world's capacity for cuteness ended at bunnies,    and then I discovered kittens
When I came to high school, I met Erin    Franz, and decided that it should be a law to have anyone cuter than the    one, the only, the original "Cute Little Bear
She's so unbelievably cute that I basically lose my    mind whenever I'm near her
Talking to her takes my breath away, much more    than running or swimming could in the hardest workouts, or the fastest    races
The thing that really makes this quote from her ridiculous, is that a    minute before she was talking about how another region band player said    "It's cute how you were running around before your audition
When you buy a new sweatshirt, and the insides are soft and warm and new    and clean, you just grin as you put it on and think "Oooooh Fuzzy
And when a big fluffy dog (or cat, or squirrel, or whatever you're into)    comes up and let you pet them, you just like it
Or when you're warm and comfy in bed, and you don't have to get up, and    you have nothing to do all day, and everything is just good
Even if    nothing's good, being warm and comfy in your big fluffy bed, under your    warm fluffy blanket
Feeling loved and appreciated
Being missed
They're all related to warm and fuzzy
So anything warm or    fuzzy
Meeting someone new who you really like
When a friend calls you cute, then gets really embarrassed
When someone says something really, really nerdy and all of a sudden you    feel like you belong
Like you're perfectly normal
Like you're not alone    anymore

cute little rabbits     Having someone laugh at your jokes
Kicking a jerk really hard
Being picked up by someone big and carried around
Running really fast and not feeling tired (for once)
Much better than workouts
Well, they would be if I didn't have to keep up with the fast people
Someone making cookies for you
Baking for someone you care about, and imagining everything going    perfectly
Baking for someone you care about, and everything ACTUALLY going    perfectly
Asking a loaded question and watching people squirm
Eating so much you think you weigh 1000 pounds
Its pretty fun sometimes
When you remember something perfectly, right when you're supposed to
I don't have a good memory
or good brain in    general
Something Important
Something that makes you    feel incredibly powerful and strong, but at the same time tiny and afraid
Laughing at something so hard it hurts
Having someone laugh with you
Someone who gives you a really cute smile
Posing in front of a mirror
Even if it's just sign language
Getting away with a secret
Having a plan to take over the world (just in case)
Daschle: "I donno, the first time I got my kittens I guess
During a rushed day
On a    Math or Science test
When you're writing an essay
When you remember something
Like if you've been struggling to come up    with a word for hours and it just hits you
You just have to say "YES
THAT'S IT
It's happened to people around    me
I haven't done it yet
When you have a substitute in a class you hate
When your favorite team wins (Matt Cook's Seahawks)     "Conqueror of the Hill makes me happy

It never gets old
Annoying people
It's her favorite    sport
People dressed up weirdly
For Swim team
For Opening night of movies
For    Halloween
Or, those people that wear superhero or mascot outfits
Those are great
Having a friendly rivalry
Usually, in honors classes for the highest    grade
When did that happen
I hope u were protected
what
it was more    like
It was when I was little
Like not exactly happy, but    nothing's wrong
anything more specific
Everything in its place
Like    everything was drifting along sweetly on a lazy river
Nothing was hard    work
The sun was warm, the water was cool
Things were just perfectly    fine
And that's how they should be
It's hard to describe
I was    actually really surprised too
Well, I didn't really win it, it was more    like WE won it
but still
Don't think I'm just some    teenage girl for that, it's something I like to do

Buono: "I like seeing Jeffrey De Lucca
but she put on a very juvenile voice when saying    it
About how I should    stop being a guidance councilor and go back to teaching English classes
And how I shouldn't mess with people's lives
Watching the Godfather
Or Ghostrider
One time in English class, we were supposed to be writing an essay on    "last night's reading assignment
Not a single    person had done the reading, and we were all screwed
When babies sneeze
sneeze
I take their word for it
When you're just incredibly dead tired and everything is really    ridiculously funny
When you get someone to snarf (shoot milk out of their nose)
When you get someone to snarf solid objects (those chicken nuggets REALLY    hurt, in case you didn't know
When you get to eat ice cream before bed
Snorkeling
Watching goldfish swim around and around and around and around and
Splashing in Puddles
Singing/screaming really loudly when nobody's around
and then finding    out someone was in the next room over hearing the whole racket
I like traveling
Like in summer, you get to just go places,    and do things
and    that guy said you were really cute for running up and down the hall
like compliments and stuff
When someone gives you a really good massage
Passing notes
Or sending letters
In Cape May
summer stuff
And beach stuff

The Anticipation     Tommy Seabrook has a very interesting outlook on his life
One day, he    shared it with us
He's so incredibly predictable that the lunch    ladies know him as "the pretzel guy" and there's a rumor that he flirts    with them as he gets his pretzels
I think the Anticipation of the second pretzel is    really a lot better than the actual second pretzel
Because I always buy    my first one, and think `Hey, that was pretty good
I think I'll have    another one
It's sooo cute
I had to go to a special school to fix it
When you finish they hand you a special diploma that says you've recovered    from it
When I finished, they said I was one of the fastest recovery    times ever
I asked Will
Like a lot of other people, he took a minute to think about    it
Will's a little different though
Instead of just thinking, I'm pretty    sure he went back and re-lived every happy experience of his life
His    eyes looked far away, and glossed over
His pupils got big, the blue of    his eyes took a deeper shade
His mouth was stuck somewhere between    "zombie slackjaw" and a grin
Suddenly he turned back to me with a goofy    smile

That's one of my favorite    things

When you work really hard on making something really funny

hey there
I'm right about to leave for X-treme Camp, and I was getting pretty    bored
But that's ok
You see, when I get bored, I usually look for things to do     First I had to finish packing
and when the Siutas make a packing    list
you better be prepared to lug around 100 pounds of slightly    unnecessary things
I don't think I've ever had to use four towels in one week
ever
I can relate to needing 10 t-shirts though, who wants to lounge about in a    shirt that was COMPLETELY soaked in disgusting
I mean, seriously
Not many people
But on the other hand
5 pairs of    running shorts is a bit excessive
This is probably because I'm used to only wearing two different ones a    week
and that's only if one gets muddy
I mean, for one, shorts don't    get that dirty
Shirts do, so change them all you want
But really
shorts
The only thing I can think of is that you get massive gallons of    butt sweat
but that's why you wear things underneath shorts
If you    were wearing Biker shorts, I would recommend changing those every day
but we're not doing that
For another thing, they told us to bring a pair of sweatpants and a    sweatshirt
I was thinking "its summer
I opened my window, and a blast of FREEZING cold    8:00 AM air came in
Brrrrrr
So I shoved a longsleeve and a pair of sweatpants into my bag     If I get any colder than that, go find a blanket or something, geeze
The thing that REALLY gets me is
FOUR TOWELS     Seriously, I cant get over that
If I lived alone, I wouldn't even OWN that many towels
Oh wait, it says "4 towels/washcloths"     Hmm
Well, I have one of those scrunchy lather thingies that you put body wash    on
I think that counts as two towels
I (being the doubtful/paranoid type) obey the voice that says "if they    want you to have towels, just listen to them
OR ELSE
Seriously
that's a lot of towels
The more I think about it, the more I think camp is going to ruin my life
And I don't mean just because Rosie is there
I've never felt I was like    the other guys on the Cross Country team
I never really fit in, I just    followed them around basically
But now we're all going to be in the same    place
and what if they don't like me
And Rosie
is sort of a lose-lose situation
Either A) I can ignore her,    B) I can try to fix things and fail, C) I can try to fix things and    succeed and D) I can, well
get with her
Either way I lose: A) She still hates me, B) she hates me even more, C) I    know for a FACT that I'll screw it up again somehow, and then I'm fucked    for life
or D) I'll lose you
Plus, her family is there
watching, judging
Its dej`a vu
I just cant deal

jk, i only lost like 5 lines because i thought "wow i wrote a lot
you    know how much it would suck to lose it all
and then when i was writing the first draft of    this

Eastern Daylight Time |    +----------------------------------------------------------+     hey, i just realized that the REALLY long story in the email that you    shouldn't read has um
like one word to do with optimism     dont worry, be optimistic anyway     its good for your health     not only that, but you need more cheer in your life     too bad about the dance on Friday     hey, i have to get on with writing my lab     so i'll see you laterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
M
Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     Hey Jeff, you know when I said I had something to tell you today
well,    here it is
and it came true and i'm like ready to cry
Well, I had this dream, and you were in this dream
and to make a long    story short, you got a girlfriend and always hung out with this girl and    never had any time to hang out with me and you never wanted to hang out    with me and thi was like the scariest dream I ever had, only not really,    and I woke up crying
and wow, I've really been crying a lot
I used to    never cry and everything is wrong this year     I literally am failing school in ALL subjects except Math
I     m probly even failing Gym
and I can't even run
When everyone always    uded to say that running was my life, I never realy believed them, and I    always ised to joke around about it but being injured makes me realize    that running is my life
If I'm not doing well in running, everything sux    and not matter howe hard I try nothig goes right
Right now I'm not doing    well in school and you don't even remotely like me
OMG, I'm such a baby, I'm like crying now just WRITING this
And then you're so happy and how do you have so much time to write all    that
And like Oldfield is like askin me what's wrong and IDK, is it that    obvious
Well, I'm gonna take your advice and try toi be optimistic
I was alright    today, bnot great but not bad, I thought I hid everything pretty well    untill after school
It's just when I hide all my feelings I get really    pissed really easily and I'm mean, and I don't want to be and i see myself    doing all this and i ant to stoip it but i keep going and
I'm sorry,    I''m  such an idoit, why am i telling you all this anyway     BTW,are you really sure I didn't gve you that letter
It's not in my room    and that's where it'd be
and I'm almost postiitve I gave it to you
Do you remember where you first asked me out
And how you asked me to the    Grudge
Well, everyhting could go wrong
you could ask Sasha to the    Gudge 2 in the same place
how ironic
You know what, I'll just stop dictating to you, b/c that's not what I    should be doing
If you like Sasha you should ask her out
But just    remember that I'll always wanna be your BFF
and I still wanna get    together with you and chill
Oh and I wanted to apoligize gor this week
We'll start with 2 days ago    when i flipped put b/c I thought you were like looking down my pants when    you were really just smalling my hair (I was already pisedd off that the    1st person I saw was Fedor and that she actually stayed at my locker and    that was just the final straw) Then I'm sory that I said mean things about    youwearing susoernders today (even though it was kinda funny)
and I'm    sorry for anything else that I might have done which I'm positive there    are more things I'm just too depressed to think of them right now
Good luck tomoorow
Maybe you'll save me a seat on the bus next to you
Hey,m you have the    potenial to get 1st in JV
Make me proud
I got 5th- excepot some bithch named    Meg Fitz cut me off at the end)     Oh an I almost forgtot to say, I wasn't pushing it that hard at the end of    the race
If I was really sprinting you woulda know
don't worry, I    thought about it, but obviously not enough b/c I'm such a loser and I'm    such and idiot and i pushed it too hard

Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     you know, you say i have no time for you and i never think about you
but you have a habit of turning things backwards when you're depressed
For one
i dont want to be this clingy ex-boyfriend, especially when    every time i try to get all buddy-buddy with you, you sort of give me this    really angry face and wont let me
Fedor really doesn't trust me at all, but she let me hold her hand (until    she found out i was just mooching her body heat)     so yeah, i guess there's no way i can win there, either you hate me for    being clingy or you hate me for giving you space
not really angry-even though it REALLY does    look like it)     And then you're so happy and how do you have so much time to write all    that
here is perfectly good proof of you getting things all backwards when    you're being a grump
its so cool
It happens, and even if other people are better at it and a LOT more    consistant (i sort of grump out a lot of the time and hide in the    corner
well, for one, i didn't have so much time to write all that
for you, i completely blew off the Physics lab and homework, so i was up    until like 12, and then decided to take a nap and do more in the morning    (so i got up at 5 too
The whole time, i was sort of thinking "wow    physics sucks
not sleeping"     and even though it looks like i just said all that to make you feel like a    horrible person, i do have a really really good point, and if i can just    capture it really well in writing, then it'll be pretty obvious why    someone with my personality and goals in life would really choose    writing
So then, after my dad walk in my room with this amazing disapproval of    what i was doing at 6 in the morning
i finish and have about 20 minutes    to sleep before getting up in the day (even though i was sleeping for 5    hours, it felt like just a nap)
I really didn't expect to sleep, but i was cold and tired and just wanted    to lie down and rest for a bit before i had to go to school again
And for a bit, i just lay there, and wondered "why is my heart racing
All sorts of memories came    back
Last time my heart was going like this was the last time i was alone    with you
done by a punk band that nobody's    ever heard of
a pretty darn good one too i    thought, but i mean, way to not leave any comments :P (although the idea    was to be hyper-optimistic
not done so well either
or sleep
or doing    well in a JV race     i mean seriously     and then i suddenly felt like everything settled down
while i got    really pumped up
it was like i slept for 10 hours straight
and then getting up at 5 was    just a little thing, and now i couldn't get back to sleep, but its ok    because the world is still spinning and if i don't live life today, then    it'll just keep going without me
So i get up and i have this feeling like "today matters"     Because i did something for you, things actually had meaning

com/contests/contests18
shtml     go go bulldogs           ummmm oh and i usually somehow get stuck sitting with one of our senior    guys and we enjoy a reallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy silent trip to wherever we're    going, so i would be GLAD to sit with you
its just that i really feel    strange saying "can i sit with you" to someone when there's an empty seat    in the next row
i guess i dont have all that
planning skills to see that if i dont    shove myself in with a good friend, i'll get stuck with someone who's    being a stranger
oh yeah and sorry for spreading rumors about you
but if you were an optimist, you'd realize that it means i'm just    jealous
and stupid     you can forgive stupid people can't you
did i have anything else to say
hmm well, don't expect me to be free this weekend, because i need    somewhere around 11 NHS hours
seeing as being an evil, lazy bum    entitles me to an extra hour of work
and Holmdel, JV, and Jeff
they go so well together     and cookies
but we won't get into that     especially since i'm the last race     but hey, someone told me something about how i needed to bring food
what is that
nobody told me until today during our run     some sort of picnic
weird     (she added on the following in a separate but not really important email)     Oh, forgot to say that it's not Even Dingier
Although he is hott and it    wouldn't be bad to go out with him but he probly doesn't even know Iexist    out of gym except in lunch     (to which I said in another non-important email)     "Oh, forgot to say that it's not Even Dingier
Although he is hott and it    wouldn't be bad to go out with him but he probly doesn't even know Iexist    out of gym except in lunch"     haha it took me about 10 minutes to figure out "Lexist" meant "i exist"     sorry
and hey
don't use the hot with two t's unless you really mean it     its saved for people like you (my lunch table still makes fun of me for    the time i was talking about this
oh and hey, in my own defense, after you mentioned you met someone, and i    saw you in line for tickets to the dance, i mean
just put two and two    together
it does look pretty fishy, but if you tell me that you weren't then i    guess i could just believe you
whats the worst that could happen
i jsut realized that the worst that could happen is STD's but that's so    amazingly unlikely
so we wont go there
M
Eastern Daylight Time               |    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+     haha Jeff, when I said I met someone, I did "meet" someone but not like    meet someone, if you know what I mean
Kris Ryan if you really wanna know
he was out for an injury which I just won't describe, plus, you probly    know about it
Yeah, and he was nominated for homeecomming king so    there's like no way in HS that I'd be going with him to the dance
If you haven't realized, I'm a little stressed out over all th work I have    to do this wekend but probly nowehre near as stressed out as you b/c of    all that community service you have to do
haha and you were making fun    of me for doing all that stuff and now look who's in the lead
Anyway, I didn't realize that was your story
I figured that was the thing    you were writing that you almost lost
Sorry
But it really didn't make    me feel much better, only realy  super hyperactivly jelous
Are you making an excure not to sit with me
Gasp
No, I really want to    sit with you so yeah
never mind
haha, but Even is hot but if you really wanna know who's hot it's
cliffhanger but you already know, but I found someone better
YOU
Yeah, and no prob, as long as you clear it up, I just don't get why you    come to these comclustions, you coulda just asked me before spreading some    random rumer
I wanted to do that  pod thing and I was looking for that    and my brither happned to be there so I was gonna aske him but then I    found out it was for the dance and it was like an army thing for the    ipod
But really, my point is, why didn't you just ask
haha, yeah, then maybe I'd give you those STD's haha
git down and    dirty
Wow, Jeff, how many girls are you going after
You've got girls all over    the place, like 10x the amount of guys I'll ever have
I'm so proud of myself, I'm so optimistic
and I'm really glad you put    that thing about making yourself feel better by staying up late b/c I feel    HORRIBLE right now and that makes it like
00000000000000000000000001    better ;-)
Maybe ya wanna git together next weekend
After that I have that dumb    German comming for like 3 weeks and it's also Brown

9/4/09     Last night, at Owen's Suite, I hung out from about 9:30 to 2:30
There I    told the story about Tessa's visit
It was disguised as a tale of a    prince, princess and Jester
We're not sure how well it was taken
I was    thinking, at one point: "the current style of being does not well coincide    with who I am anymore
I need to fix this
Where we loudly discussed everything about weed
I decided it was about time to take off
and do
SOMETHING
My first instinct was to just call up Owen, and chill at his place
Considering everyone else hates me
So I did
After I discovered his phone was off, I discovered that it turns out there    wasn't much else to do but to roam off to his place for no reason
Nick Gabinet and Han-Wei Kantzer
Here's the thing about Nick
He attracts the weirdest folk
I mean, his    best friend (in my opinion, not his own) is Alex Melman
Alex is one of    the sketchiest kids I've ever met
He basically does whatever he wants    pretty much when he wants
During our    lockdown drill, he told some teacher that the whole thing was stupid, and    that he wasn't going to just sit in the corner
He was going to talk, and    walk around, etc
The teacher started getting all up in his face about    "ok, well, you can get shot if you    want to
Oh well,
UPDATED
9/18/04    im working on a very secretive project
its very secretive
it    involves a very heartfelt letter, and a LOT of self doubt
NONE OF YOU GET    TO SEE IT
its very private, and its about something that REALLY counts,    so i wont let anyone see it
in other news, today i added two shorts that interlock
they actually    were written one day apart
Life's great
A final note, the "much anticipated" release of the chain mail stories are    at the bottom
very spiffy
heh     Updated
2/4/04    Oh, has it really been that long
I started a new project-LGB(little green book) Chronicals
the Second Year
Its a complitation of short stories, but I wont realease it until this    summer because Its still too personal
teehee    right now i'm "wooing" someone special named C
S
Sylvia, this should bring back some "fond memories"    Just somethings I want to clear up for no reason at all, The only reason    im not talking to her anymore is because shes too beautiful
it blinds me
No, really, im a wuss
but we all know that already
another thing is that    no matter what anyone says, I still think that Lyricstime
com is still the    best lyrics page ever
Maybe sometime soon, Ill bring this up at my lunch    table, which was robbed of one of its more interesting members as I    accidentatlly pissed her off and she moved to the table where all the    girls used to sit
Conner sits there, and I hate him
Another thing that I think need to be cleared up is that whoever stole my    other LGB chronicals pages does not need to give them back because that in    itself give some humorous "make fun of the Idiot writer" material right    there
no, seriously, I want them back really
If you have them, you    shouldnt bring them back since im still pretty mad about that, even though    I have neither the strength or will to beat anyone up over papers, I'll    probably give you a dedications
that sound good
This space is reserved    to the guy who stole my LGB Chonicles manuscripts ____________
there
Updated
2/20/04    from now until i decide not to anymore, i will update every week day from    3-5 because thats when my brothers play My new game-Baulders gate 2
they're both grounded and hog the machine every chance so i usually go    online for some War3 action
but those days are over now    look at the very near bottom for my vote for the next while
Updated
2/21/04 the whole vote thing doesnt really work    no one really visits the site    i moved up the vote since some people are idiots
also, you email or    just tell me what you want     Updated
2/23/04    well, im trying my best to work on this on my free time
its not easy with    Baulders gate waiting to be beaten
i spread around the 2/20/04 and some Actsofgord
com stuff
There were    three types of people
1-its too long 2-hahahahaha 3-i hate you, and you    misspelled this word wrong-note, that this is the same grammar that they    use
i also added a    quotes section, which will stay there forever, no matter how many people    vote against it- so far i have three votes
Tom's idea is the best, but im just a tool of the peoples, tom
I cant    play favorites unless i really want to
Updated
3/1/04    happy belated leap year everybody
right now, im still not even close to finishing the most recent lgb    article
im also working on weeding out various extrodinarily odd errors in    spelling and/or grammatical errors, but i have little to none help since    no one even visits my website
I've decide that soon, like when im done with the article, ill delete    early conversations
If the title is still early converstations, its cause    im not changing it, but congratulations on noticing
Another thing im working on is Battle of Souls, which will in part take up    early conversations and will fully take up my mental focus and time
Email me if you get this far, and ill give you a dollar, if i remember,    and only then if you nag
and only then, if you remember that my saturdays 8-12 AM are holy, and    must never be desecrated
unless it really cant wait, or the cartoons are    all re-runs
and only then if they aren't good re-runs either
and only    then if th
nevermind, no saturday nagging
updated
3/21/04    lassie
just had to get that out of my system    since last time i did anything on this site, i've done a lot of thinking    and a lot of watching and i've noticed a lot of things
For one, i hate    the new font size aol is using
it sucks
for another, some of the people    i know are really good looking, and i've never really been one who cared    much about these things
Or, all of my friends were ugly, no offense
I    bet its me growing up
While doing just that is inevitable, and does have    some perks, I really don't like it at all
I have people nagging me to    shave, but that would admit defeat to the tiny hairs on my face
You can    barely see them through a magnifying glass, but people nag anyway
on the    other hand, not shaving too long would confirm my dislike of sharp pointy    things called knives, and would prove that the non-existant hairs are    there, thus proving that i'm growing up and care about looks
Another thing of profound importance, is that i cant find the famed time    traveler essay
thats bad
but on a positive note, i wrote "dark    imaginings" and will shortly write something not yet title
if you got this far, i have three things to say to you
Shame on you, go do something constructive
Congratulations, you got this far, you're not illiterate and are truely    "bored like me" thus proving my worth
You should email me, so i can confirm my own worth
thats about it, so i should either go to work or go to addictinggames
com    both are fine
maybe even imabigmoronwhocantrememberhislines
com    its a real site
On a final note for today, everybody read scott adams's Dilbert books
I    get most of my "original" material from him- its hilarious
Updated
5/11/04    If you are who you should be, then you know exactly when i say what i say
I try my best to reach out to people like me, but we're just to darn good    at hiding
I feel so alone, mostly because i'm afraid
I don't really know    of what, but right now i'm not trying to make anthing happen, just sitting    by myself waiting
Updated
6/9/04    to tell the truth, i wasnt that shocked to see that my last update was    nearly a month ago
if any of you need a new definition (actually an example
Dorkwad DeLucca- thats me, got a perfect 100% on his first    marking period grade on science
then, he goes practically lights the room    on fire, and his average mysteriously drops by 25% in the fourth marking    period
as in, i have no chance of getting an a, b, and willl mostly    likely miss the C mark
the whole thing is explained in a LGB entry for today, so why don't you    scroll to the bottom
AOL keeps changing my fonts against my will
Updated
8/9/04    ok this isnt really an update, because im a lazy slacker and spend most of    my time over the summer napping or nothing
oh, and this one time i    wrote up a bunch of random things that STILL arent finished
the reason    im writing this today, is that its just amazing how alike my brother and I    are
just go to his xanga website, hes YOURFACE321 by the way, it'll be    at the links at the bottom
anyway, every word is exactly, and facinatingly exact im talking, like    blow your mind out creepy, my own
in real life too
the most recent note    of this, im looking at a box of snowcaps, and i see- "semisweet Chocolate    Nonpareils"    normally i'd think "mmmmmm sno-caps
another thing is his girlfriend was about to    show us a Doctor Quinn Medicine Woman video, so i look at the back of the    box to see what its about
everyone looks at me all funny and notes    that about 20 minutes earlier my brother asked that same exact question
just saying is all, but thats freaky
UPDATED
9/4/04    i got a new website    i dont plan to do much work, with school and whatnot, but i do plan on    doing some fun writing, and passing it around for all to see
during this    summer, a conversation was passed about, that told all the goldman    stories
I hope to find the time to adapt it to one website or another
also, this ADD story came from a mail from a close friend of mine    thats going around too
everybody-eagerly await the release of those
NOW
basically,(this is a really good story
very exciting) We go out on a    warm up a bit early for my liking
and decide to jog the course
The    course is like
3 miles so understandably this is a far way
especially for JUST a warm up
so we jog out about a mile or so and the    race at like 11 goes off
Our race time was at 11:40, so we had a bit of    time to burn so we get off the course and jog amid the trees off to the    side
Richard has to go back for something
and just dissappears
The    rest of us take a 5 minute walk to let everyone pass us and continue on    our jog
We get back to our little camp and theres no Richard
It doesnt    really matter, because we got about 20 minutes for stretching and things    and
Understandably im kinda    confused
I plop down as if nothings wrong and change my socks and shoes    into racing shoes (they weigh next to nothing and haVe nice little holes    to put in spikes for those hardcore races where anything goes
The other ones, i discover have really big holes on    the heels as i take them off
then turn around and see a big    ol' line of runners in the skimpy little jerseys
get over there now
About midway I do a long strider to quickly close the gap
On the    way I hear a lot of screaming at us
mostly involving "HURRY UP
I plop down and do some light stretching     Richard (YU) gets really mad at this
Get Up
Jeff
GET    UP
GET UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
NOW
The man takes a few more steps and i notice the gun in his    left hand
I look up and take my place    on the line
He turns, raises the gun and
This time i'll medal, I know i    will
Its top 45 runners for god's sake
The gun goes off and we surge forward struggling for an early lead and    hoping not to get cut off on the first tight turn
Richard always goes out a bit too fast for my liking, but I fall about    10-20 feet behind him firmly in the top twenty
I look up and start    counting heads
1
2
3
4
5
6,789
10
wait
damn     I start my count over as we turn tightly around a white pole
last year    so many people cut me off here, but this time There's practically nobody    in front of me
1, 2
3
4
5
6
I strech out my legs on the first    downhill and pass three or four people and start to count again
1, 2
wait wheres richard
He's pulling ahead already
maybe i should be up there
I decide against it
I dont want to get all tired and lose my great    position
I give up on counting soon after the first mile passes
Its no use when    im passing people left and right every time theres a hill
Soon we finish our first loop
We get back to the first pole and the    downhill
Im suddenly in the top 5
There's Richard
already fading    into the distance
and I'm with a pack of 6 or 7, I dont know how many    are right behind me
We follow the second loop over to a bridge
THis is    familiar terrain
it was part of the shorter Freshman course that i did    last year
I suddenly realize we're almost done
and im not the least    tired
ANother downhill I pass everyone but one runner
He practically sprints to    maintain his lead
We fall back into pace until a slight uphill
I see a    pole ahead and think "Hes going to cut me off there" I try to pass
he    sprints to keep ahead
I try again
it doesnt work out so well, but im    definately pissing him off
I pull ahead near the pole and stick it
only i sort of over run the pole and make an awkward wide turn
Hes    right next to me, but his pace is slower so i just casually run ahead
I let him pass me as we turn around some baseball field, and he falls back    again
We go on like this for a while and every now and then i actually    have to work to pass him
Some coaches say we have a mile left
I speed up and ditch him
Woot
THen
i get tired
one mile left my ass, the next coach is barely 200    yards down and says we have half a mile left
I try to put some distance    between me and the one kid that gave me a good fight
RIchard's a tiny    figure in the distance
I only have myself to pace with
then
a forever time later
we REALLY have half a mile left
only    not     I thought we only had a half mile left so i sped up some more, anxious of    losing my awesome second place rank
I thought that I was closer to the    finish
I thought there was just a little bit more and then the one lap    track finish
I thought he was right behind me
I pass another familiar landmark
and realize
NOW i have 800 left
just    a half mile and im done
I dont know how far behind the other guy is but    i will not let him pass me
I lenghten my stride
Im so tired
I'm    breathing heavily and my legs burn
All i can think about is "what time is    it" and about how i CANT lose my place
I Have to hold him off
Finally track is almost in sight
the Traffic guy holds back some cars for    me, but these two girls walk in my way
So tired
Here
the track
I look for the entrance
GOD NO
we have to run all    the way to the other f***ing side of the track
then come INTO The    track and run a whole lap
SO tired
I think about walking the last    lap of the track
I cant lose to this guy
a friendly biker reads off    the time for me 17:30
GOod, i'll get a PR
I Get into the track at    17:50
reading the bright green letters at the finish line
I look for    Richard but cant find him
So tired
why is the track so long
Richard got first
we have to get 1,2
The announcer guy says so
I try to sprint the last 400, but im so    tired
I imagine the other guy right behind me
must go faster
so    tired
I make the final bend of the track, and see a random line of cones,    barriers and officials
where the hell did a plain old finish LINE go
I    did it
he didnt pass me
I enter the crude shute made by the three    kinds of
line makers
and jog it all the way to the back
let the official do it"     oh ok
can i stop jogging now
please
I dont know where the official    finish is
was it the beginning of the shute
before the shute
in    the middle of the shute
Its all so terribly confusing so i just jog to    the offical waiting with a smile
She grabs my tag
but not before    making me blush by firmly planting herself and holding out her arm in a    "stop" motion
how was i supposed to know     the next official give me a strange, cheery "good job" and gives me a    string
It takes a second for me to realized its a medal
Silver
Woot
I'm so tired so I walk into the middle of the track
its nice and    grassy there
so tired
I find some team mates and Richard     "yay
second
my coaches and a few of the team members come up
and eventually through    some explaining (its hard to understand when ur tired) and name calling (I    KNEW we had 20 minutes to stretch) and some bragging (I got second
be    proud of me) and of course some random jokes
it was explained
we accidently went into the earlier race for    smaller schools     Smaller schools mean less competition means slower times
We utterly    destroyed these fools because we have bigger school
Oh too bad
we'll    just make the same mistake next year
The officials were really nice about it, and we even scored as a team like    we were a small school
I got double medals- silver for being awesome, and    bronze for being the second most awesome
and having other awesome    people
Mostly it was me
Sticks and Stones: How to Become a Runner in 30 Days
Me and Christian are on a bet
I bet I'm going to beat him at the mile
If    I do, I get to slack off as much as I want
If I don't I have to work my    ass off until I beat him
Its as simple as that
The thing is, everyone's telling me "you'll never do it" "its impossible"    "DUDE
You're going to have to drop like 10 seconds
just run faster    than him ONCE and Its all over, and I get as many tries as I need, and    three, I'll probably have to drop like 15 seconds
It's a piece of cake
But, who says    any of that is a bad thing
All I need to do is kick his ass in the mile
HARD first lap, let him catch me second, work up on him going into the    4th
then just break yourself on the last one
Make sure you finish
that part's important
Also, make sure you finish in front of him
That's pretty crucial
People've been saying that I CAN'T a lot more lately
There's no way I'm    going anywhere but Rutgers
It's almost impossible to beat Christian
I    wouldn't last two weeks in Spanish 5 Honors (I'm also told that I need to    test into AP Spanish
The only one I'm iffy about is Rutgers
To me it    feels like I have two options
Rutgers and Ivy League
There's no middle    ground, and there's no dipping below those two options
But, this isn't about those things
Those are just drifting about
Another    case I'm going to have to look straight at all those doubters, put on a    huge grin, and just say "sticks and stones"     But First, I'm going to have to beat Christian
A damn sweet mile time can    make College easier, and if I can beat Christian, then Spanish is no    match
I've always been scrawny and dumb
but more scrawny than dumb    regardless
so if I can find the strength to run 4:35 ish, then I'm    definitely smart enough to take on a little foreign language
The first week: Drills and relaxing
Work those shins, Don't move another    muscle
It's pretty healthy
It's pretty fun
It's a good life
If you ever want to be a runner, a week or two before your first real    practices, start doing shin drills
Walk on your heels while pointing your    toes to the outside until it burns, then drag your toes as you walk so you    stretch it out
Then walk on your heels while pointing your toes to the    inside until it burns, then drag your toes as you walk to stretch it out
Then sit on a table or a desk, or just a high chair or something and do    "happy feets
Move your feet like you're drawing a    U until you feel your shins burn, then strech them out by either just    rubbing up and down the shins or dragging your toes on the ground
Having strong shins is good for a few things
The arch nemesis of every runner
Having strong shins        (you're working the shin muscles, not the bone obviously) will help        cushion impact and prevent those evil shin splints
As far as I know, ankle protection is done by only two mucles
Your calf- making sure you don't break in the forward direction- and        your shin-covering the back
The sides are not very muscular, which is        why twisting the side is so much more common (that, and the foot is        pretty much in the way of you screwing something up in the front or        back
But still, having strong shins will help protect ankles from        injury
When you land on the front of your feet, you're going to go        down, then up
Push your toes into the ground
feel it in your calf
Hold down your foot and pull your toes up toward you
That's your        shin
Shins cushion your falls
Basically how it prevents Shin        Splints
My week was pretty darn relaxing
I have to admit
And, I didn't forget to    do my shin drills
I'm off to a good start
3/5 First day of Practice: I'm 45 minutes late
Not a really great start, seeing as everyone already thinks I'm a slacker
I was doing an interview with Laura about swimming, so technically I had a    good excuse
I jogged over, as my warmup, and was about to do an extra couple laps to    keep warm while I waited for the team to get there, when they all swarmed    around a corner, and hopped the fence right to where I was
Everyone joked about how incredibly late I was, and that I was a huge    slacker
It was cold, windy as all hell, and half clouds, half sun
Sticks and stones
We did this: Cruise mile (6:50), Cruise 8 (3:
By the end of the first set (mile, 8) I was kinda hurting, but I held on    for all of it except the last lap of the last 8
In the middle, Christian said to me "you're not looking so good
but I'll get better, don't worry"     "I'm not" Whenever I remind him that I'm going to beat him (yes, I know    it's pretty "cocky" of me, but I know I can do it
I have to) he always    gives me the same "I'm not very worried
maybe you should start    trying
Very sore
Hard    first day
too cold
Came home and did Crunches
didn't lift at    school
4/12/07     I forgot I was doing this
Oh well
Christian is injured (shins)
I'm sucking (Spring break ruined me
And so    did not sleeping)
On the plus side, my weight is rebounding somewhat and    I'm back above the 120 mark
or at least I was
Not sure anymore
Hang    on
Yeah, I'm pretty healthy
I'm falling behind
Nik Hansson is getting    pretty beastly, and I'm not where I want to be (SPRING BREAK GRR
It's    not all my fault
I did like 25 or 35
but my body hurt like a lot    because I was in just reg
shoes
Btw, all that walking ruined those    shoes
They feel seriously like flipflops now
I walked home in them    today: my feet hurt from it
And I went for a bit (less than 20 :P ) on Monday before coming back
Tuesday: workout
in 45 degree weather
windy
fast
Considering I was    just coming back from 90's in AZ, and hadn't seriously run for a bit
my    body got kind of shocked
3 split 800s
fast on first 500
damn slow on    the rest
Didn't even finish
started puking yellow-orange junk so hard    it came out of my nose
Didn't have a lot of it in me
so that's nice
BTW, puking hurts ur abs a damn lot
and in the wind
Blew itself all    over my face and shirt
probably ruined
I'd better start catching up before Christian comes back
Only have like 2    weeks at most I think
Btw, It's been 30 days
Maybe "how to peak in 30 days, then suck nuts    trying to catch up for the rest of the season"     Who knows
if I keep at it maybe I'll breakthrough late season
Be like    a regular PA (Dota Reference
I've forgotten how to train
And I've forgotten how to be myself
I think I'm going to work on these from the bottom up
Who I really want to be is Good
I remember him
Right now I feel like    nobody
I think I could do better than a faceless name with a history
8/12/09     Technically, I am an alien time-traveler with superpowers
In reality, I'm pretty much no different from anyone else
So, it turns out, that in the future, humanity will become capable of    interstellar travel
And will colonize a few other systems
By blood, I am    from one of the first of those outposts
The air there is, understandably, a little different
Turns out, the way    that the outpost was created is also a mix for creating lots of little    quirks in people that present themselves in interesting ways
The simplest way of saying it, is that we all started getting "connected    in unforeseen ways"
Most of us gained limited telepathic reading for    those we have direct eye contact with
A few also gained "dream-reading"
Others had heightened senses and other physical attributes
I heard of    someone who could literally smell fear (or so he said)
Nobody really    cared too much after the first couple of years
And then they started noticing that after prolonged exposure, we started    breaking down
People going crazy, getting all sorts of illnesses, etc
etc
So, we picked up and left
By the way, this is all just from stories
I was born within the colony, but beyond these basic things, I never hear    much about it
After we left, were labeled as "colony failure refugees" or CFR's
Turns    out, it was much more common than anyone really planned for, and we were    assembled into camps at the nearest inhabitable location
Our colony was lucky
We had something that the governments wanted
In    exchange for information about our colony, and the rights to use it, we    were given first priority on permanent homes
Most of us were separated,    but given the circumstances, everyone thought it was for the best
My family, and a few others, were given homes here
I'm told that the effects of the air are permanent, and that I probably    have under-developed powers
It also turns out, that generally, it's completely unobtrusive to regular    life here
My family was not highly educated, or particularly well informed (our    schools were very different than they presently are
Apparently there'll    be an interesting cultural shift when the global population hits 20    billion
Also, because I was    raised here, I'm essentially like any other "alien"
I have a culture that    has been completely left behind, and have been raised to belong here
My    children will fit in perfectly, and I'll fit in almost perfectly
There is no difference between me, and the next immigrant that you see
So, despite being a "time-traveler alien with superpowers", think of me as    an immigrant from somewhere far away, but who came here with parents who    adapted quickly, and raised me to belong
ABC, rather than FOB, and definitely not "science-fiction kid"
First of all, is this a date, or a group outing
And if it's just me and her, do I want to go to my brother's place
No     So
If date, then find out if she already ate, or if we should go out for    food
And give Kevin dinner another time
Options: A) borrow the car, and go to a movie, then ice cream
B) borrow the car and go to a restaurant
C) chill at her place and do `hw'
If group outing, then go make food
Today I got permission from Steph to brainwash her
I got the idea because we're reading 1984 and Brave New World
both    about controlling humanity (basically)     I know that's probably the exact opposite of the point of those books
and our education
but still
Its like when we learned about Eugenics
and I was like "if only we    could do that
but without the massive slaughters
back when there were slaves
It's    just such a good thought
anyway, I was thinking of maybe trying to get her to drop most of her    texting
maybe I'd start with an additional bit of meanness over IM's and    texts
but be really nice in person and over the phone
and the fact    that I don't have texting would help a little anyway
sort of encourage person-person
and discourage by words
but everyone likes notes
even tho they're slower
The coup de gras would be if I "txt-msg broke-up w/ her
but whatever
then
her away message was this:     Auto response from lstephhl [10:04 P

Plus, its gonna be hard to be mean to someone online and in txts for me
since i'm more of a writing type person myself
it's a lot harder to    come up with crappy jokes in person
Plus the whole being mean part too
At the time, I was thinking of    taking out Maddie's name from a few of my "melodramatic confessions" and    adding that line, and I wrote it on my arm
Subconsciously, I think that I    knew what I just realized recently
I wasn't talking about Maddie, or one    of my dumb stories (I'm sorry stories, I just needed to make you look    unimportant
I    was telling a bit of this story to Tiffany and Megan A
Its    officially sad and creepy
Tiffany was bragging about how clueless I was to them flipping my    backpack, but I rebuttled with the fact that because I had to hold it by    the handle, it was much easier to just drop and give Marissa a hug
Megan    looks at me funny, so I have to elaborate
Fists are IMAGINED to raised as everyone fantasizes of    beating me
it was good because I could just drop my backpack in the    room and get a hug
eyebrows raised and heads shaking
well
umm
you know
It happened last year, and the year before that
I hate how tunnel-visioned I start to get when this happens
At least this    time, the person I randomly and for no reason whatsoever (whoa, I was    about to say "fell in love with")
got a crush on
likes me back
so    all is good until I become enough of a jackass for her to dump me
That point being mentioned, I will now go on to the story I began earlier
It all started (for this story at least) yesterday, and what a fine day it    was
All my troubles seemed so far away, now it looks as though they're    here to stay
ohhhhhh I believe, in yesterday
First, a short visit to Marissa's table, everyone expects me to go    there often, because I did
then I would take a very slight visit to    Steph's table, and very quickly go buy a Candy-gram
One dollar pieces of    love, and they support the freshman class too
Unfortunately, Brandon kept looking over and reading what I was writing,    so I didn't say anything sappy, although I was planning on it
I also
had a momentary lapse, and couldn't remember her last name, so    wrote     "Marissa Iforgetyourlastname     Greco"     Ah yes
so very loving I am
I feel like I'm    Sarah
and that's not a good thing
So anyway
turns out that Kelsey Smith saw me doing all this
and    eventually had time to read my candy gram
which was signed "YOUR BEST    BUDDY (and maybe something more
the strange and unusual things that happen to us all
Oh yeah, sarcasm never works unless you're awesome, which I used to be
Now I'm just cruel     Oh yes, and that night was also the X-country banquet
some
decently    good times
I
totally ignored Marissa-making me feel very guilty, but    not pushing me enough to go talk to her
Instead, I acted like an ass with the other freshmen, ate a bunch of food,    and had a decent time
I got complemented
And you know what happened
I wanted to give Zalot a hug, but he said    "don't you give Stienberg hugs all the time
yeah
I mean
no
well
Go away"     aw
he made me feel like such a special person ten minutes before    (probably more like an HOUR
that awards ceremony went on forever), and    then he went and wouldn't give me a hug
just because Stienberg said    so
Me and Stienberg had a little chat later
well anyway, all I wanted was a hug
So anyway, now the date is today, December 3, it's a Friday, and lots is    happening
Before homeroom, I apparently looked very depressed, and    worried Abby, Julie, and Cam-eel (eel
Sorry, that's how her name is    pronounced) to pieces
Then
I holed up in my homeroom and did my math    hw
which I never finished and got credit for anyway
Then
gym time
we were supposed to have a peer leaders thing, but    that never came about, so we just had a study hall
I took off my shoes so    that I would have a good excuse not to play basket ball
and immediately    started flirting with Sophie
in front of Marissa
Sophie wouldn't let    me put my hands around her because "YOUR TICKLING MY FAT, YOUR TICKLING MY    FAT
then Marissa turned bright red    because I started taking a nap on her shoulder
She proceeded to beet red    when everyone made fun of her reaction
It worried me
if she turned    red
isn't that NOT good
Who knows
Flirting with Sophie continued later
Ah
yes, then lunch
I watched Marissa leave with Anna, thinking    nothing of it
then went to show Kristin my stories
and hopefully    distract her from the candy-gram I wrote her about five minutes ago
I    walked out into the hallway, and my expectant smile faded
MARISSA WAS    KISSING ANOTHER BOY
Just kidding
This was worse
she was sending candy grams
only    took a split second)     thinking "must
play
innocent
that WAS dumb
don't have to sigh to yourself while reading it
Unless, of course, I'm hovering around you looking for a sign that you    like it
SMILE, or something, I'm probably DYING by now, commenting "it    took you longer to read it, than it did for me to write it
not very enthusiastic about reading them
she    made a seemingly absent minded comment about "oh these are good" when she    only read one
I was learning a new language
I don't know what language it was, but I    helped myself to Kristin's flash cards
I am FIRMLY in denial that ANYTHING at all happened during social studies    class
And
if something DID happen, I wasn't thinking about condoms, I    was thinking about things that would be better kept a secret
Also, it was    strange how indifferent I was to Sophie, even though a few hours before I    wanted to give her a big hug
please note
I REALLY wanted to give her    a big hug
it was scary how much I wanted it
Before eighth period, usually the last time I see Marissa before the day    is done, I did my special, avoidant way of apologizing
She caught on,    which I was very thankful for
And
I gave her a BIG hug
before    social studies class
the class which nothing happened in
Oh yeah
that big hug was the one I was telling Tiffany and Megan about    in the beginning of the story
The day ended strangely metaphorical it seemed to me
We walked to her    bus, and I spent my time wondering about for a bit until she came back    out
We walked back to the school, chattering about whatever came into our    heads
She accidentally skipped her turn, so went down the 200 hall with    me
people started coming down the hallway, so I ducked into the first    room
I expected Marissa to follow me, but she didn't, so I jumped back out and    followed her a bit
My sneakily following was noted by John ("I DON'T KNOW YOU," thanks)     Then Sean wanted a high five, so I skipped ahead, and hurt my arm when I    missed his hand
at intersection of the 200 hall, we went our separate    directions, each looking back longingly as if words were going to be    passed, but ashamedly kept a secret forever
And so, at the end of the day, I am left once more with a simple    knowledge, a question, and a new clarity in my mind
Marissa definitely likes me
What if that candy-gram incident ruins everything
or it wasn't for me
I can now get hugs with anyone I want, because I officially have    permission
Oh, and me and Owen had a philosophical discussion
It was one of those things that if you were looking on from the outside,    you would think one is being a retard, and the other one is trying to be    serious
And absolutely none of the things they were saying make any sense    to you
I have a strange mind
and it likes to distract itself and    others-(example
This story)     Its amazing how those words still resound in my mind
The blood drips from    my lips as the simple phrase is uttered over and over again
Writers are summoners and warlocks     4/27/09     When I read Owen's writing, I feel as though I am eating some part of his    soul, and that it is becoming a part of me
A foreign entity flows in my    mind and in my veins
It is the same for good writers
They create the sense that what they    described is real, and not only that, but it is significant
They desire    for the reader to sense that the soul they feast upon is real:    substantial, nourishing, and comes at a high cost
The soul is one of    great value, one that has powerful effects upon consumption
And when I write, I've felt as though I've captured something, or someone
I have frozen something forever, that can be released and consumed again    at any time, multiple times, by multiple people
So, do the greatest of fiction writers summon a being from nothing, entrap    them with words, and feed them to the masses
Do we endlessly feast upon    the liver of Prometheus
Are we the eagle and the human both
I guess that would make Dualism make more sense

Tales to Richard: Thursday September 18, 2008     Met Maureen: Wednesday Septermber 17, 2008 - Breakfast
I think this has been the third person you said was going to be your Kita    replacement
And I thought i remembered taht when you came back from a college visit    you met someone who was kind of like me
You were telling us at lunch    once, and you got high with him and slept over at his place, i think
I really do think I'm into tall asian girls, which is sad because tall    girls don't particularly like guys my height, and I've been looking kind    of bad recently, with the whole not running thing
I'm definitely serious about smoking with you guys, because I'm not good    friends with anyone who does it over here
and I want to try it at least    once
Someone on my floor seems to think I'm a lot more fun with a couple of    shots with me
Other people on my floor were shocked that I was even out,    let alone taking a couple of shots
Sadly, after my second, I decided to take a little break
and then they    took the bottle away and tried to get the pudding wrestlers drunk with it
It didn't work out so well
Those girls hold alcohol very well (unlike me,    it turns out)
Even with a room full of guys chanting "take it off
but they seemed to respond well to "make out
When I went home last weekend, I sought my family's advice on Omlettes
If you've ever been to a fancy hotel, they sometimes have people that make    omlettes to order, right in front of you, usually taking care of 3 or 4 at    once
They're always perfectly cooked, incredibly delicious, and flat out    awesome
Rutgers has one of those people
Sometimes two
Anyway, I had a long conversation with my family about omlettes, and they    told me that once a week is healthy, twice a week is pushing it, and more    than that will kill you
So, Wednesday morning is my omlette day
I was looking forward to it SO    MUCH
But I don't want to go alone
so I called up Steph Yang, because the    first wednesday we were here, we ate breakfast together and i had an    omlette
Steph
texted me back "grab takeout for me please"
NO
UNACCEPTABLE
I stormed over to her place, my response to her request "nope" and later    "we need to talk" <-- my least favorite expression ever, but the situation    demanded the use of this deadly, scary phrase
After a brief chat about how important wednesdays were to me, she    explained that she was up until 5, and had to do homework, and there was    no way she could go
I gave her a dirty look, and looked around her floor for breakfast    buddies
Its ridiculous that in a school with 30,000 students, not a    single one is eating breakfast
at 10 AM too
So
I venture forth alone
Omlettes can make mornings better
Ham, bacon, green peppers
what am I forgetting
Cheese
right
Hm
do i want anything else
Maybe onions
Maybe next time
I feel like    there's too much stuff already
Oh well, we'll see how it goes
I grab a tray, fork, knife, spoon, and head to the omlette station
Uh oh
The cook's not there
Uh oh
The lady's putting away the ingredients
UH OH
NO MORE OMLETTES
I was so sad
The next best thing is a waffle (made in special waffle irons that has an    R stamped in
They're very good
She has a green shirt, and a modern asian girl    haircut
Her eyes wander about the room, and I suddenly think "i should    sit next to her and say hello
she seems like me"
But
instead i poured out my batter, flipped the iron, and used the 2    minutes of cooking time to text steph about how much i hated her, and that    i'd be back in about an hour with takeout
But the strangest thing happened to me
My waffle was still grilling, but    all these people started showing up around me
There was this one really    hot girl who gave me a big smile, and a funny look
I gave her a funny    look back because i thought i knew her from somewhere
but i've been    having bad experiences with taht recently (Specifically, shouting "I KNOW    YOU
you dont
Also were two people, who both had plates
As the timer counted down from 15, I looked down at my tray, and noticed a    specific abscence of a plate
I don't have a plate
OH NO
You saved me
I panic for a second, before it shuts    itself off
I grab my waffle, and wait to syrup it
I'm about to charge off to find a seat
when i see the    greenshirted asian girl again
And then
I think to myself (she's    sitting alone
So i sit down a few seats away from her
and look at her
She seems kind of spacy
As I eat my breakfast, i notice more and more she seems to move like me,    and think like me
And also, i become convinced that she doesnt speak    english
And after a while she sniffles
and I suddenly notice the chair next to    her is pulled out pretty far
Maybe she jsut got dumped and is totally not    looking for a perfect stranger to say hello
And maybe she's mean
or anti-social
Or really shy
Or really doesnt    speak english
maybe she's not a freshman
and therefore not interested in    meeting some frosh kid
Is that what happens
I feel like it is
Or it    should be
Or shouldn't be but happens by natural course
But mostly, we both kept trying to read our surroundings, and sitting    quietly, both of us taking sideways glances at each other
I thought to myself: "we're totally the same person I think
Maybe we were    supposed to meet
Hmm
that would be strange
I think we were supposed    to meet
So
if this whole breakfast goes by, and I don't talk to her,    does that mean i missed out on life
or that i'm just a huge pussy
I    definately have to talk to her, before we both leave and go our separate    ways forever
and then she walked right past me, and i got really confused
and then she came back and said "HEY, I know you
She walked into    his room and sat down on Owen's room mate's bed while I was taking a    nap
and sort of stared at us for a while
So i got up and started a    conversation
and then I never saw her again
we were all going to go to dinner, but it was closed so I went home, and    they all
did something
But her saying hello again was a SHOCK
When she first said something, I    kind of flipped out, and I'm about 90% sure the asian girl laughed
But    when it was all cleared up, my heart was still pounding, and the girl was    very composed again
I took a deep breath, and thought about leaving
And then, I remembered    what I was saying about how we were probably supposed to meet, and i would    be sad if she disappeared forever without me ever meeting her
So
I tried to figure out a good way to say hello
The first way would probably be to just say HELLO
I'm Jeff
And then I remembered all that stuff about how it's ridiculous that in a    school this size nobody wants to go eat breakfast
Or "I've always wanted to go up to someone who's sitting alone, and    introduce myself
but I never know how to do it
I thought to myself:    you'd better move fast, she's been here longer than you have, and you've    been done for like 5 minutes
So, with long lazy arms, I pulled out the chair that was one closer to    her
She watched me with curiousity
The chair got stuck on the ground so it    was hard
I scooched over and waved
She waved back
Hello
Umm
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR
Do I know you
what    the hell are you thinking
I um
haha, have that effect on people
Oh
Hmmmmm
We wasted like 5 minutes, I'm pretty sure both of us knew it was such a    lie, but we played along and "tried" to figure out where we had possibly    met before
We talked about who we were exactly, and the entire time, I just kept    thinking to myself: "you sound like a dumbass" and "damn, we're like,    exactly the same person
Sometime soon I'll have to invite her to something
Or    somewhere
I'm really excited
She seems totally awesome
And she's just like me
only two years older
I hope she likes me
POP
Yay, that's a happy noise
Pop
Pop
Pop
Ohhhhhh
Anyway, back to the subject
Oh wait, YOU DON'T HAVE ONE
Hahahaha, that's a good one
I guess, since there's nothing better to do, I will commence in one of my    long rambling stories, which only have a point A) if you think I'm    philosophical, and analyze my writing for all those little tricksy things    that I HOPE nobody ever notices, or B) you can actually CARE
Hopefully, if im lucky that is, you're both
So this is the story on touching
and the effects thereof
It all started at lunch
Or
more accurately when I was born
Or more    accurately, it ALL started June 30, 1990, but this story starts at lunch,    Monday, November 22, 2004
As with all good stories, it begins with a girl
That girl was Marissa,    and she was very ticklish
As a result, I learned to keep touching to a    minimal with her, even though I wanted to touch her the most
So,    naturally, I took my fingers elsewhere
They are, by the way, quite soft    today, despite the unusual chlorine smell that still emanates from it many    days later
That's why I don't like swimming this year especially
Makes me smell    funny
No matter HOW much I scrub it and wash it off, it still lies there    in my skin, and still smells
only my skin pays the price of my    scrubbing, and not only smells, but is usually dry, and has the    disagreeable habit of flaking
And so, it was lunchtime, and I wanted to touch
I also wanted to eat    something, but since it was a half day, lunchtime was officially at    ten-thirty ish
Anyways, I touched
It all started with the hair
it was all poofy, I couldn't resist
Or    more accurately, my hand couldn't resist; I had nothing to do with the    whole incident
The hair happened to belong to David Nichols
But that didn't stop the    hand
I was soon cast out of my table
mostly my fault as I was the one who    shamefully skipped off from the table
So I went to Stephanie Taromina's table
About half a second    later, I realized what I said, and about a second after that, half the    table started laughing at me
The other half just sighed and went about    their business
As my hand snaked off to Stephanie's hair, I absently became engaged in a    slightly disturbing conversation
Giggles ensue
If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it    doesn't count unless you think about it
As one of my favorite quotes    goes
Henry Miller  The moment one gives close attention to anything,    even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably    magnificent world in itself
See
Its great
Its also what happened to be what I was thinking of while    watching "Our Town
Oh, and if it makes a    difference, the whole time, to prevent loneliness, I was playing
Flirtatious games with Archana
I hope nothing happens because of that, even though we ARE close personal    friends
So anyway, I was playing with hair, not realizing it, when it gets pointed    out to me
tried to "dirtify" me once
For about a month
or two
or three
they constantly touched me, and gave me hugs and fondled my arms, and I    shrank back, like the tame little boy I was, and tried to make them stop    it
Good times     Anyway soon Elijah protectively stopped me, and john stood up to make me    leave, stretching to his full mighty height
I just grinned at them and    skipped off to my next adventure
I wondered to Monica's table, and sat    beside her, getting to know
someone whos name I forget better
Then I switched to the seat across her, because of returning people
knowing exactly what was going to happen next ("so, hows things going with    you and Marissa"
Always that same thing
it's a good thing I can    actually learn from the experience) I distracted them, as I am so good at    doing
Interrupting them mid-sentence, I stroke Cathleen's arm
Or I think    it was Cathleen
Whatever
This
works perfectly, and the world hushes around us
My hand is pushed    away
I lift it up again, and continue to caress her skin
Its pushed away again     Not the skin, my hand
Well its skin too, but
Nevermind
This continues for a bit, but I get bored with being hit in the arm, so go    back to my original table
After hovering around a bit, I get the question "why were you stroking    David
It    happened to be EJ
If you don't know, I always kind of thought that EJ was evil
she just    seems that way a little bit
And she's unusually strong
Kind of freaks me    out
I poke her again
Seeing nothing happens from the first one
Poke
poke
poke
she makes a grab for my hand, but I easily dodge    it, and poke her on the hand
Poke, dodge, poke, poke, dodge, poke, dodge
Then, out of nowhere, she pokes me right in the chest
That was UNEXPECTED     I mean, who would have thought of that
Certainly not me, I was shocked
You poke arms
Not bodies
Then, I TRIED to tell you the story, but you
seemed a bit disturbed
Speaking of disturbed, what REALLY disturbed me was that angry GLARE you    gave my brother, he kept bothering me about it
It was quite the stare,    and I was even behind you
Another thing that's disturbing is how much of a loser my OTHER brother    is, he spent his lunch with his friend making fun of me
Doesn't he have    anything better to do
which everyone already knew
Oh, and that whole hidden message up near the middle of the first page
Yeah, I guess that whole "I like you" thing is officially in effect
Do I    get a hug now
Apparently I'm not as normal as I thought     Maybe it's just a boy thing
Things    such as "what if the world were tilted sideways" is something that's    perfectly natural
Everyone should have pondered that at least once,    generally on a lazy Sunday, when you're trying to find excuses to lie in    bed for a little longer
And dreams should be something that people give more than a little thought    to
Apparently I have very odd dreaming habits
Having once eaten a meal    "while I was asleep" (I had partial memory after the event was recalled by    my family), and attacked the wall at least 4 times (once leading to a    bloody knuckle), I wouldn't say I'm 100% normal, but certainly less far    out than those around me make it seem
I'm beginning to slightly agree with my father, that it's incredibly    shocking how dumb the average person is
But the people I know are not    average
They just tend to be much less curious minded than I consider    "normal"
Far less imaginative
If I had to describe myself, (rooted from an internal conversation with    the Sasha in my mind
Starting with the wall, and flowing to "what are    you thinking about"
oh hell, why don't I just put it all out
Me: what are you thinking about (a penny for your thoughts
etc
what were you thinking about
Me: Well, I was just thinking about how it's rude of me to just put you on    the spot like that
Sometime people just sit and listen to the silence
Or
the noise
Or sometimes, they just want to think private thoughts
Or sometimes they're just hitting an empty space in their mind
Also,    whenever anyone asks that question, you immediately lose the train of    thought and it's hard to remember what exactly you were just thinking    about
Unless it's something sort of big
In which case, it always comes    out sideways when you change it from thoughts to words
Because that would definitely solve a lot of my problems
I don't    really like words in general
They don't fit the way I think so well
it was you
Her: do you think about me often
Me: YES
Far more often than I should
But not in a bad way or anything
Just more than
than a normal person should
Especially    considering I don't know anything about you
What do I really know about    you
Not much
just that (a long list follows here, ranging pretty much    all topics
Things that I shouldn't say, and things that are obvious
Things that explain the way she is, and things that lead into more    questions on why she works the way she does
But how much can you really    know about someone that would actually fit into words
Nothing that's    important can really fit into words
Temporal Distortion
Hypocrisy
I would    like to say imaginative, and that I think too much; but I'd probably be    fine in a completely empty room, in utter silence, doing nothing for about    6 hours
Marissa, before you get started reading this there's something you should    know
Oh wait
you started already, so now you have to finish or else you feel    like a bad person, or maybe just like you want to know the ending
Well anyway, what I was going to say that it's my full intention to write    no less than 8 pages, so you might want to find a comfy chair, and about    an hour to kill before continuing
I know you said you liked my writing, but you know
a lot of a good    thing is sometimes not the greatest thing
It might be OK, and sometimes    is way cool, which is what I'm hoping for
The idea was this: I have to come up with some REALLY good idea to knock    your socks off and make you want to stick with me just so you can be    invited to my awesome anniversary extravaganza
but you know that wasn't    working out so well
First
I was trying to find a nice little easy way    out
maybe buy you some balloons or get some flowers or something
but    you know, that didn't work so well
I sort of came across the idea that you don't really like a lot of things
I thought about the flowers thing and you know, that idea is not only    completely unoriginal, but really impractical, what with carrying it    around and such
Besides that, its pretty sketchy having a flower on one    of the most random days of the year
I mean Halloween is about to start    and here you are playing with a flower in the middle of class
The next    obvious choice was to just bring you some flowers out of school, but then    where would the fun be in that
they'd just sit there and look pretty
Wait
that sounds pretty good, I'll keep that in mind
Right, and balloons
this brought a bunch of really good stuff to mind,    and it took a while to sort everything out
Speaking of sorting things out
this room looks really crooked right    now
It's the strangest thing
I guess the best way to tell this part of the story is to go to today
Why is it that we've been going out for a year and the whole "she    loves me, she loves me not" question still goes around and around in my    head
What am I going to do
I lied back in the comfy green "loveseat" and propped my feet up on the    pool table
I was doing homework, but I took a moment to try and sort    things out
I felt guilty about doing all this homework when I should be    kinda a bit more worried about how the real world was doing
And that    immediately lead to this Friday, our one year anniversary
I was supposed to be doing Math homework, but it slipped in importance in    the sudden feeling of just sitting down and letting myself die quietly
I    really hope I'm not depressed because that would really suck
So, I just had to think
Sort things out
Lets see, what can I do for    this
one year thingie
Ideas flowed to mind and I viewed the random    chain of images as they came, analyzing each one as if it were a criminal    evaluation
Every detail and angle must be seen so that the innocent go    home unscathed and the guilty are punished for their wrongdoings
It    seemed oddly fitting because
well I'll just have to see about that    later
The first thing was a party
I made a mental note to see if Abby actually    is throwing me a party
I looked up over to the left, to the top of the    shelves of books
I my mind I was tracing the path of hundreds of balloons    floating outside Marissa's house
Wait, you cant just do that
its not healthy, and all those balloons are    just going to float away
That's no fun
So they sank
About a million balloons fell from a netting
It was in the    gym, and the thought of the balloons sinking to the floor in a glorious    rain brought back memories of the opening of the new gym a couple years    ago
It was a very random thing, and there was really no reason at all to    have these balloons fall down about the front of the stands
I was too far    back to get them, so I just watched now as seemingly thousands of balloons    drifted steadily down from the sky
The dull yellow mass fell about    randomly and I just watched it go
Now I had a hundred balloons fall down from the balcony outside your room
It seemed like a good idea
But helium balloons are so much cooler
I got a great mental scene of    you trying to suck out the helium from the balloon and making the funniest    face while doing it
I leaned back on the couch in your basement casually, and said in a high    pitched, squeaky voice "see it's not that hard
Now I was at my house staring from an    imaginary room at the things going on around me
There was food, of    course
Chips stacked high in a colorful bowl that we didn't own
Cheezy    poofs lounged in another just like it and a few people snacked on those    while chatting
In my living room people were watching movies and sitting in various    stages of comfort
Have you ever noticed the sort of things that people do    while watching movies at parties
A lot of people sit upright on the    couches
A lot of people lie down on the floor
But things get awfully    complicated at big parties
Then you have people lying on the couches
But there not quite enough room for that
That means that soon enough    people are sitting off the edge leaned back onto the guy lying down
And others piled up leaning against the sides of the couch
One person    gets to sit on the armrest, and there's usually a nice comfy spot sitting    on the ankles and calves of the person lying down
Other times, everyone's sitting tightly together, so if someone feels like    stretching out a bit, they lean on a nice row of two or three other    people
The shove their butt into whoever's the unlucky fellow to be on    that side
Or, everyone sits, and the last one to reach the couch finds    out its just as comfy and twice as much fun to lie down on all the    sitters
Of course the floor is always a nice choice; with the option of leaning on    various furniture, or picking any number of poses on the floor
Other    times, there's those parties where everyone just crowds around the food    and talks over the movie commenting on funny facial expressions and the    like
Soon I realized that I needed some activities for this
party
In my    backyard I could suddenly see waterballoon fights and some nice    "supersoaker" action with those huge waterguns spraying everything in    sight
Then I realized its kinda cold for that
So, the next idea
RACES
or maybe Tag
You know its things like that    that always made me want to be a runner
So yeah
runner
you know not    everyone likes to race, or play tag when its completely unfair
I    mean
Cross country runners used to going really fast for really long
vs
people who cant finish a lap on the track without hating their gym    teacher for making them run
wait that's me
Well, people wouldn't have that much fun
or at least as much fun as me
So scratch that
How about a Jumping contest
like to see how far you    can jump
That didn't work so well last time
Darn
Alright
how    about how high you can jump that was the most fun thing ever
I got bored    one time at my house so I used a bunch of furniture to find out how high I    could jump
and that other time I used a balloon
ITS SO much FUN
You    start with a foot stool thingie
then jump over that
then you add a    pillow, and go over that
And eventually you're trying to jump over half    your body and still making it
but then get REALLY tired from all the    jumping and cant make it over the same height you just went over
So tired
Anyways, I guess I shouldn't have all these competitive, semi-physical    games going on because yeah
Which reminds me
we should play Frisbee
Wait
darn
I sighed and looked back to my Math book
The blue book cover made it look    rather unhappy
I should probably do my Math homework
I had a good idea a few days ago about this
or more like yesterday
Is    it just me or did it seem that Brown was like 3 or 4 days long and not    just 2
I was thinking about having a party, so the first thing that popped into    my mind was that since you always thought I was cheating on you, I should    invite everyone who I ever "cheated on you" with and then It'd be like    this one hilarious bash with all these random girls (and a few REALLY    random guys) and be like
yeah
And then I thought about how then you'd have nobody to talk to
well,    Cael would HAVE to be there of course
and so would Anna and Maddie,    because they're so cool
And Kristin Trauvagline would be there too
And    then
I came to a screeching halt
I really don't know absolutely    anything about your life
Oops
And there's
um
Jamie
And    ummmmmmmmm
Yeah so I got the funny idea of
Jeffrey walks up the 200 hall looking expectantly to the locker B-115
Perfectly on time, Marissa is unpacking her things
She looks dazzling, as    usual, but Jeffrey just admires the view knowing that unlike in his mind,    physics do not conform to what would be nice
Doing a little hop behind    her and giving her a death squeeze-type hug would probably result in    accidentally tripping on something, falling over, clinging to her during a    falling thing
or getting smashed in the face as she turned to see what    the loud, unusual thumping was
He casually comes up beside her (or as casual as a goofily-built, lanky    teenager can be) and says, "so
Can I have a list of every girl you    think I've ever flirted with
and a bunch of your friends so you wont    get lonely while I'm cheating on you
But they're pretty nifty when you think about them
Hmmmmm
that seems like a pretty good idea to me
I donno
I had a lot of ideas on cards and things
except some of them were kinda    stolen
See, if its our 1 year, then shouldn't it be like a memory of all    the other stuff that happened in our time together
Obviously the eye is drawn to exactly what happened on the 21st one year    ago
You know
First of all you could    just go on and say
now I have to be in love with    you for like
who knows how long
just kidding
This brought up a random thought
I would write a gigantic story, so long    that it'd have to be special in some way
On that word special, I sort of    thought about how this would truly be for your eyes only
and mine
You    know, I get really distracted sometimes, because that brought this image    of me typing a huge 8 page story blindfolded
Only a little later did I realized that a lot of things were shared    secretly between us, before I had only been thinking of the most recent    writings- the ones which I went about showing off, and occasionally felt    guilty for just leaving you bored and waiting for me, a crowd flocking    about me while leaving you with nothing to do
This brought the very BAD idea of making this one on one bond very    unique
through the simple process of photocopying everything passed    between us and handing out copies to everyone in sight
It was
a bad    idea
So naturally, with the bad idea out of my system, the good could return to    their usual ceaseless flow (oh, I know, I'm so smart
Well, for one, I could play off your    comic book, and that was an entertaining thought for a while, I might have    to make it
The comic book had mostly a lot of you running around doing stuff and a    little stick figure of me sighing and saying sarcastic things left and    right
I wish I could remember some of the better parts of it
So from all this madness, this was born
don't you feel lucky
By the    way, from now on
your favorite author is me
I never knew people had    favorite authors, but then I realized that I do too
so yeah
Abby made    fun of me because I was asking if too much of a good thing is really    crappy, especially when it comes to
pop literature
Apparently so
You know, there's one thing that doesn't really get old no matter how much    of it you have
That is chocolate
One of the best ideas which you should have discovered in the morning
was to fill up your locker with so much candy, namely chocolate, that the    whole thing poured all over the floor when you opened it
First you're    calmly going over to it and thinking of which books you need while idly    chatting with me, and suddenly woooosh
It's like, what the heck is going    on
And then you suddenly realize, CHOCOLATE
Either that or its more like, woosh, then ouch
as you slip and fall    right on a piece that made its way under your foot
I can imagine that    too
When Jamie asked me what I was going to do for our one year, I said    this
so she said "that's so sweet
its so    SWEET
haha
So many ideas passed through my head, but only a handful stuck, and I    suddenly remember a few during random times in the week
Like today,    something struck up the idea of the T-shirts
I had actually come up with the base idea a long time ago, back when    people kept bothering me on whether or not we had kissed yet
So the idea    was that we wonder about the hallways together, and every time we see    someone we know, we simultaneously shout their name "HEYYYY, Thomas
Not only that but it could be pretty fun
Its funny, because every time that idea came up, I always go to imagining    us going down the language hall towards the end of the 200 Hallway, and    seeing someone and being like, "sigh
so tired
I mean, we know a lot of people
it could get pretty tiring by the end of the day
So anyway, while on that subject the T-shirt idea came up
Instead of
that we would just walk around as usual and people would suddenly notice    that our shirts were basically the same
So, rather interested in this    uncommon similarity, they would read the letters, and suddenly come to the    revelation that our shirts WERE matching
It would take both of us    standing side-by-side to understand the message
It would really confuse    people during the classes that we didn't sit next to each other
namely    every one but Language Arts
It was a really good idea wasn't it
It would be all like
We-----`ve     Be------en     Toge---ther     F (------)R (for)     ONE---Year
On one side it'll say "Webetoge fone" and the other will say "`veentherr    Year" It'll be the funniest thing
Well, it would be if you hadn't already    thumbs downed that idea
You know, one of the reasons I started writing this is because I sort of    had a lot of ideas I never really told you about
Some things were sort of    obvious, or I mentioned them in passing but never really explained
A    bunch of things were just things that I was just thinking and never said
Isn't it so sneaky
It was my secret plans and
stuff
A lot of secrets
I don't know if you can really call them that
Those    ones above weren't really, but the next few could definitely go in that    catetgory
You know what the best thing about secrets (are/is)
You always have some
Well, not in like, you're always going to be a spy or something and have    lots of skeletons in your closet or anything fancy like that, but I mean    that there is always something that goes unsaid
Otherwise you would be    talking about
15+ hours a day
I mean, I can do a lot of talking, but    you can't go and talk that long, spilling everything there is to tell
Like, say for example (woot, a sidetracking story, I SERIOUSLY haven't had    one of those in SUCH a long time
cough cough) you tell people    everything that they don't know about
so that it's no secret
Therefore, you announce
a little bit can get lost in translation when talking "in    code" like that so, right while everyone is having a giggle fit about this    un-stealthy announcement
they'll add "Number 2 means Poopy
IT WAS GREEN
Sometimes stuff like that makes good    stories though, but personally, I keep it a secret
So anyway, now that we've firmly established that everyone has and endless    supply of secrets, I just thought that we'd move on to the point I was    trying to make
If you'd like to know a little secret, I have to look over    on page 5 to figure out why the heck I shared that nice story
Alright
so as far as I can tell, the only thing I was talking about was    that everyone has secrets and they don't really ever run out
That's    something very nice to know
I mean, its great fun
Every time you either    forget a secret, or it leaks out or something, then you can always know    that you know something that only you know
Hee hee
I can only assume that in my mind I had a point to make, and it almost    definitely involved you in some way
So
What do we want to talk    about
because I don't know about you, but I have about 2 and a HALF    pages to kill here
DIE DIE DIE
Um yeah, that was a real useless comment
I mean it didn't even get rid    of an extra line
I need to learn how to waste space better
You know what's the absolute best for wasting space
Dialogue
That way,    every time anything happens, you just put in a new paragraph
I mean,    everyone knows that
Its just common curtsey
Otherwise things could get    really confusing
The next bit, will be me, talking, to me
Anyone looking at him would think he was    depressed, but in truth he was just really tired and liked to look at the    shiny little dots on the crosswalks
As he walked past he saw each one    gleam as the angle of light lined up so that the light bounced perfectly    back to his eye producing a happy glow
If he had looked up he knew the    reflection of light made an interesting patter on the ceiling, but he    always got these funny feelings
its more like you're really tired    from something and it sort of gathers in your head
hehehe"     "
Oh right
that's stupid
You know, all that emotional    drama can have physical side effects
that's why those sorts of phrases    exist
Duh
I'm in like
the flat grasslands of love right    now
There's no drama
just check out what she said yesterday
Won't even kiss me
hehehe
stop it with the puns, my head is NOT that heavy
Though it was true    that his relation had hit a
rather low lying plateau, he seemed to be    constantly reaching for more
And from where he was, there was definitely    a lot of stretching room and the best road is up
I am    so starving right now, you cannot even imagine
Its funny though, because    it keeps going away and coming back
I don't really want to eat though    because I'll have to brush my teeth again if I do, and I'm only planning    on staying up until my laundry is done
I thought    they were just hugging, and averted my eyes anyway, but as I passed them,    there was
Lots of noise
quite familiar wouldn't you say
It could mean a COUPLE things at    least
Haha
It was a lot better
um yeah, it could
Anyway, for one it could mean that one REALLY    loud
Or it could mean
You wrote it in her locker once
What
You meant that I've definitely heard it REALLY often in my    dreams
Mostly daydreams, but you know
when you're doing Social studies    homework, its all pretty much the same
Woo, excellent story
I love it how not only does it communicate    absolutely nothing new, but it does it in the most
well, either    dumbest or interesting way, depending on your point of view
The thing with people making out in hallways, is that I always feel really    torn between the "EW" reflex (where you don't know whether to stare or to    just look away, simply because its so gross) and the sort of guilty    "yeah
Maybe it's me
They are the most rebellious things in my entire body,    not counting all the stuff inside my body that does not enjoy the things    that happen to me
My hands completely refuse to follow the rest of my    body and mind on the whole "15 year olds should not be this much in love"    idea
I mean, just because I REALLY want to most of the time doesn't mean    I go around giving spontaneous hugs and kisses left and right
Well, hugs    are alright
NO
right, focus
well, those hands
GRRRRR
I mean, only like    20% of the time they randomly reach about your body do I actually tell    them to
That whole holding hands thing
it makes me so immensely happy    I don't even know what's going on half the time
It really doesn't make    much sense
I mean
HELLOOO it's an HAND
It should not be influencing    the entire mood of the rest of my
self
Grrrr
anyways
You know, every time we hold hands, and I get that random euphoric    feeling, I always remember this one quote from Jane Eyre
The little    girlie was allowed to wear her dress
or something of the sort, and she    sighs happily, and it describes her as "her cup of happiness was full
Like there is no possible way I could    feel better than right at that moment
I just sigh and my entire body    fills up with this incredible sensation
Wait a minute
are you like, slipping me some sort of crazies drug
or    maybe you stick a needle into me with your hand
and I get all happy and    stuff
That must be it
Well anyways back to the hands
Sorry about all the reaching and touching
It's just that you always look so good and my hands are really rebellious
Like that one time I sort of accidentally stole some stuff from Sophie
SO    not my fault
Well, anyways, it's like my hands really like you, and you    know, they don't have much of a problem with showing it
Hmm that didn't come out so well
Lets see
a better way to explain all    of this
Aha, well, see, on the bus ride home from brown, I had quite the nice    time
At first, I was playing cards, because I happened to be in the area,    and thought that it would be good if you slept a little, having complained    a bit about that sort of thing
Also, we weren't exactly sitting near each    other, so there goes my entire incentive to sit in the front
It was like,    the best part of my whole day when you came to the back of the bus and sat    with me
You know, I think every single time you wear clothes
or don't,    I mean whatever, it is definitely one of the best outfits you've ever    worn
Well, at least that's sort of what it feels like, because every time    I see you I just wonder at how amazingly sexy you are
I mean, its like you're this amazingly perfect beautiful    person who is here for my personal pleasure
Sounds like a good life to    me
I mean, I'm sorry, you're just too sexy
I mean
Well lets see
that's not good
Well, maybe you should just use me too
That could be rather fun
I mean    like
Don't tell me what to do
get over here
only, not only is that completely
like,    wrong, but if I were the object, people would call me "pussy whipped" and    if you were they would say "slut
or that you were just    being used like a tool
Used
like a microwave
used like an old    car
used like
ummm well, I'm pretty much out of them
The old car    one was the best
Wow, page 9, be so proud of me
I mean wow
Well, things that I have to add to my original ideas
Because most of    those were in my head by Tuesday night
Now its Thursday and a lot of stuff has come up that puts me in a bad    spot
First of all, while writing this, I came across the interesting    question of why I am writing this
Well, obviously it is so long and    boring that by the time you get here, you will seriously be thinking of    breaking up with me
so ummmm, don't
Not only that, but nowhere in this entire thing does it say "happy    anniversary," (Ok, maybe it does there, but it doesn't really count) but    it sort of says all these things that kind of wont happen on our    anniversary
This whole thing was sort of starting out to organize my    thoughts, then was like a sort of gifty thing
then things went really    downhill from there
You know, Colleen put it best
followed by Abby, followed by Jamie
First Colleen said "I hate it when guys have their anniversary come up and    all they have planned is `happy anniversary' and they say `here's some    flowers I bought' when they really just pick some from their front lawn
I think I'll do that next year
No really, that made me feel like the absolute worst
I mean, I had all    these great plans and these amazing dreams, and like, I didn't get to give    any of them to you
I feel pretty awful
so much work    done already)     And you know what Jamie said: "Oh my God Jeff, you're so conceited
Do you    actually think that she likes you THAT much that she really wants her only    gift to be a bunch of your stories
that is, as Abby put it, "well, you    shouldn't go all out on your first year, because you need to top it the    next year
unless she dumps you because your first one was so horrible
Well, anyway, though most of this was written before Thursday rolled    around, I thought it was amazingly funny how all this stuff happened in    school that related to what I had already written
Well, Mr
Porter is obviously spying on me
Porter
It thought it was pretty funny
You know, I used to wonder what it was like to have a girlfriend
Well, now I know, its like regular life, except about 100 times better,    and about once a month its like 10 times worse
That's pretty good
Oh right
and it makes you bald
so don't go out with any girls unless    you want to lose all your hair
Hehehe     Which brings up an important question that will always be a mystery
Why    does your hair smell so good
I always wondered about that, but you    shouldn't tell me
Doing that would so ruin my entire life
I only wrote that so I could laugh really hard when you see the last page     This has to have been the biggest waste of space ever
This is so ugly
But it's the thought that counts, and not actually working out
Wait
is    this purple
Crap
Ok, so me and my brother were having a huge argument over this     i was being forced into slave labor by some chinese communists and    equadorian drug runners
and today's mission was digging holes and planting trees
and i was told to "step on that dirt
gently"    after you plant the tree
all the dirt is really loose and your tree    will flop over if u dont
so i gently step on it
and my dad just starts laughing and laughing
Be a man
i was told GENTLY, so that's what i'm doing
Gently"     My dad takes charge, starts stomping on the dirt with violent force
Like this
BE A MAN
you don't have to kill it
Apparently
it's COMPLETELY incorrect to say "boot stomping head motion"    because that implies that the head is one of "boot stopming"-ness    But I'm pretty sure the way i said it was right
because the Boot is stomping the head
This story could've been told a lot better
What I think I really need, is someone who does the things that I'm afraid    to do, but is there to tie me down when I float off
But in the end, isn't that we all want-perfection in someone else
But why, we all ask, would someone perfect want some dopey kid like me
Well, tell me, just one reason, that you aren't perfect
Perfect for someone like me
Am I perfect for someone like you
Sometimes I don't know, and sometimes I don't want to know
I always torment myself with the if and whys for everything insignificant,    but then jump ahead into the thing that I can't handle
Don't ask why, I'm probably just as lost as you are
But in the end, isn't that we all want-perfection in someone else
But why, we all ask, would someone perfect want some dopey kid like me
Well, tell me, just one reason, that you aren't perfect
Perfect for someone like me
Am I perfect for someone like you
Sometimes I don't know, and sometimes I don't want to know
I always torment myself with the if and whys for everything insignificant,    but then jump ahead into the thing that I can't handle
Don't ask why, I'm just as lost as you are, probably
If I had all the answers, I wouldn't need someone perfect like you
Scholarship work     4/27/09     If you wanted to, you could make it almost a job to hunt for, and apply    to, tons of scholorships
Either that, or it could be a class at Rutgers    (or any other college)
It would probably be pretty easy, considering the number of scholarships    that it's possible to be eligible for, could possibly be fewer hours than    working, and pay equally well
Also, it's good practice for writing grant    proposals, personal essays, and get you a few "won prestigious scholarship    A" lines for your resume
which is pretty nice, considering that you're    not only getting money, but you're getting the potential to make MORE    money in the future, with increasing ease
This should be offered as a small class at Rutgers
Small, not because    nobody would sign up for it, but because if it were a big class, there    would be too much competition, and it would kind of defeat the purpose
This idea pretty much only works under the assumption that there's a lot    of scholarships with very few applicants
Amanda's ASSets     I got bored one day as she was typing her Rutgers application essay
So I told her that she should make an essay chock full of sexual    innuendo
because she's so hot that they'd obviously want her in their    school
I sent it to her at the end of the period
I think my most valuable ASSet to the Rutgers community is my roBUST GPA
My Grades are totally STACKED, and I've RACKED up the points during my    high school career
In addition, over the years I've LAID down some rather    impressive scores on the SAT's
My skills are SPREAD WIDE, as I'm very    good in studies of the Human anatomy, and excelled in bio
I find the    Human body to be quite fascinating
What interests me most is Cultural    Anthropology
I'm very interested in understanding my fellow man in a very    intimate manner
I would enjoy a very close inspection of mankind
My favorite thing in Social science classes is to give presentations in    the class room
During group work, I am usually the one to HAND JOBS out
This doesn't mean I'm bossy, It's just that I like to be ON TOP and in    control
However, I'm always open to just lie down and let my partners do    all the work, if they're willing
I'm not a control freak at all
Some people say that I work too hard, and they may be right
Sometimes, I    just feel like I have to take it all off; just leave my life with the bare    minimum and leave behind all the honors classes and AP courses
When I    feel like this, I tell myself that in the end, doing all the work in    school with have an explosive climax later in life when I can feel the    joyous release of having a good job
They soft grind of high school will    give way to the feverish pushes in college, and the frantic crush of work    will all give way to the warm release into soft financial security
I used to play travel indoor soccer
The team and I would score together    and we were all extremely close
As she was leaving, I complained how hard it was to do it
I donno, mine's pretty hard
I don't think she got it
After she read it, her only response was     "oh my god jeff
What I said to John:     I'm sorry I was so cold
It's just that it's something I feel strongly    about
or at least that I know I should feel strongly about
What was said
90% of the people in pharmacy right now
I can do anything
They were without a calling, without a dream
Without any    motive
So they all decided, "I'll do something that makes lots of money and is    very safe
All of these people said "I can do anything I want to
but I don't want    to do anything
So I choose something that makes a lot of money
Yes
Is it smart
Yes
Is it absolutely normal
Yes
Is    it in any way wrong
No
But
I don't want to live my life that way
I don't want to feel nothing
I want to be around people who have dreams
I want to work with people who believe that this life is their calling
I    don't want to be with people who live without emotion, people who did not    seek a calling
Most of all I don't want to be someone who lives without searching for    something more
At the end of it all, I want to have said that I searched for something    interesting, something that captivated me every day
As I was telling Devon, I often see people    that I know, but I am 100% sure that they will not remember me
There is    Cara very often, but am often scared to say Hello
Also, there is Liz    Strange, who I saw today
Dave
Is the only one I am unsure of
He is the    one with the long hair who is very good at poker and hangs out in the    basement at night sometimes
Devon says that To those people who almost    certainly do not know you, do not say hello
But I think "that is a    terrible way to live
I don't think I could live like that
but I do

Wtf,    who's idea is this
stop getting drunk on a Wednesday, alcoholic     Me: wow
stop stalking your little brother
Kevin: News feed
It can happen to you
At around 1:30: Jeffrey fails at life     Kevin: that's because you pregamed and expos paper
Evil Plotting
8/26/09     The objectives are these: Learn more about Tessa (the way she speaks    especially
Have to figure that out for something), Screw with Owen, Get    Owen and Tessa together, Get Me and Tessa together (capitalizing Me    implies utter selfishness), establish long lasting ties between the three    of us
Hopefully she'll come visit at least one of us during the actual    school year
This moment is totally deja-vu
I remember copying from background to    screen, then going over to Owen's place and talking about something    (probably that any plans will not work out)
Maybe I should Aim to just    have fun
Methods:     Hand sex (as Kelly put it)
A lot of touching builds comfort, breaks    barriers, and is a lot of fun
List of "important things"
Trying to get Tessa to flirt with Owen
Trying to get Tessa to flirt with me
Trying to get Owen to flirt with Tessa
Seeing what all of our boundaries are
through experimentation
Important things I have to inform people of
OWEN:     Be clean
Relax
Btw, Tessa is coming
Also, consider speaking to him about the theory of how to avoid failure    when jumping into our own world: and that is the use of externality being    necessary for humor
Tessa:     We are going to be awkward, and in this sort of situation, we are going to    find out if you can REALLY not just plow through them, or if you were just    lying
Your car is right here if you feel like running away
Heads or Tails: should she make it a mission to flirt with Owen
Should we try to pun as much as possible
So Owen tells me you're a blackbelt
How do you feel about ridiculous amounts of physical contact
Because, when I'm with people that I know could completely destroy me    physically, I tend to not hold back
Don't be afraid of having boundaries
and I won't be afraid of pushing    them as much as I can

too bad CERTAIN people wont let me hold their hands
about that
am i a really not trustworthy person
i mean, i know i'm not the most reliable, but i think most people should    be able to trust me decently well
i mean, rosie and sasha wont let me hug them
and i think its mostly    because they think i'll rape them or something
and i was over at kelly's house and her mom was all like "dont touch    anything
and    dont steal anything
do i
o, and nobody likes me :(     it kinda makes me sad
i feel like jamie (i always tell her she could    have tons of guys, and she's like "that's not true, nobody likes me
well, now that i think about    it
she's not like anyone else i know
so maybe she wont really click    with anyone
then again
she's a pretty, driving senior girl
so that kinda clicks    with a lot of people :P     well anyways
nobody likes me
but that's ok i guess
oh and that's also the reason i've been all huggy and cuddly recently
im a lonely little jeff
hold me
haha, that sounds so gay, but if it ends with me getting the girls, i    shouldn't complain           marissa, you have beastly muscles
oh yeah, and before i forget, you need to stop being so hot
with two    t's
marissa = HOTT
lol anyways
but really, you need to stop being sexy
sorry for letting you catch me looking at your boobs
i'll try to be    more discreet next time           i really hope your family reads this
because that'd be SO funny     and you'd come into school wrapped up in like 50 layers so nobody can see    anything     and
your parents would hate me more than they used to           oh and all of this is
joking     yes
joking     pay no attention
none at all
i was a little hyper when i got home today
ok
sorry
jeeze
timberlane Middle School                                  PAC Action Plan                              Intervention Strategies     Date:  February 7, 2007 Effective: March 26, 2007 Case Monitor:  Sue    Brashier     Student:  Mark Barrow Review Date:     REASON STUDENT WAS REFERRED TO PAC: Mark's teachers have referred him to    PAC reporting a multitude of behavioral observations that were concerning
They include a short attention span, inability to concentrate,    distractibility (zoning out), and falling asleep in class
In addition,    Mark's homework and class work are often missing and/or incomplete and he    demonstrates a lack of organizational skills
His handwriting also appears    to be of concern
These behaviors are interfering with Mark's ability to    learn
A meeting was held with Mrs
Barrow on 2/21/07 to discuss the    teachers' concerns
She informed the PAC team that Mark was in the process    of being evaluated for Attention Deficit Disorder

Sometimes, it's ok to let your enemies sneak up behind you and stab you in    the back
Sometimes it's fun
or useful
Never doubt that there are    those that would love nothing more than to let their own throats get slit
8:24pmChris     hi     how did you get stabbed     in the back     8:24pmJeffrey     i didn't     was writing     8:24pmChris     oh lol     8:25pmJeffrey     turns out, i don't have the concentration to be a fiction writer     same character
many different settings/years/etc
also, has different mindsets along with mine (Should i consider myself    "normal" and this last problem goes away
8:26pmChris     o     8:26pmJeffrey     in this, he's talking to a cute little thing that is also an assassin     she stabs him a few times, then gets her legs blown off     that part hasn't been written yet though     i could make something else blow up
although, to be totally honest, this mirror how i feel about a girl     8:29pmJeffrey     ever had a cute friend that you flirt with all the time, and she flirts    back once a day (at most), and even though you will never be together,    it's still the most fun you've ever had
It's not healthy, but it's a lot of fun, and that's the sort of    relationship that exists a lot more than it should     (even in the future, where everything is dangerous)
I've decided something     It's a very good something, for you, me, and the combination thereof
I was going to call you, but my brother is on the phone
Grrrrrrrrrrr
I also decided something
Now, lets see
Well first off, the main thing is DON'T WORRY
That comes in later though, but for now I need to remember what I was    thinking     I HATE it when that happens
Grrrr
I cant remember
Well, not to worry, I can always fake it
Hmm
Alright     Well, the first thing is, that you worry too much for you own good
Its    definitely not healthy
I know what I was thinking
I think its because I was afraid of losing    something, usually it was emotion
You know how when you do something bad,    and you want to make up for it: that's what I always felt about    EVERYTHING
So, because of my guilt, I always tried to do either the right    thing or the thing that is VERY easily rationalized
Now, you're worrying, and I'm not
and I think a lot of things about    this
Well, the first thing I already told you, being VERY careful to    steer clear of the "L" word
even if the physical    one, well, isn't
Which, by the way, is true
isn't it
Of    course, I was half-asleep then and didn't quite remember
Basically it    went like this     She "" s me given     I think about her often given     I have an irrational wanting for her given     I= want + think additive property
Or some such thing     Want + think = "" definition of ""     I = "" transitive property of equality     So mathematically I'm in love ("oh shit, there goes the planet"-ape at the    end of Spaceballs - a good movie)     Anyways, and the other idea was that because I'm basically too busy for    you (sad, but true-between swimming, midterms, and other kookiness), my    body decided to completely shut you out of my mind for its own safety
This explains a lot
Well, now you know all
Well, actually not all
I bet right about now, you're thinking "why do I    have this"     See, there is a reason
Basically, I was trying to say something
Then    got REALLY off topic
Don't worry, it happens a lot to me, even when I'm doing something kind of    important
By the way, MIDTERMS are important
I'm secretly hoping you fail
That way    I look good, even without studying
I'm definitely studying for bio and SS    though
Oh darn, got distracted again     Oh well
Guess I'll stop typing now
No, really, just looking at this paper, there's about another page to go
So anyway, the reason I listed all those things is because I was getting a    little worried about not thinking about you, and had to rationalize it
But
the thing is, right now you're probably doing enough worrying for    the both of us
And for that I must break up with you (gee that same joke never gets old)     No really, stop, drop, and take a break
You really do worry
I'm supposed to be the worrier, I'm WAY more feminine than you are too
Its like we switched places, which is where this whole thing started
By    whole thing I mean this paper, along with that other sheet
You know, this one time, maybe two or three days ago, I did that FIRST    one: joke I mean     About breaking up I mean
And then RIGHT at the very end of the conversation, I was like: "well, its    boring to break up with you, I don't think I'll ever do it again"     So
DON'T worry
well worry maybe a little, its funny to see you stressed
Sometimes    you even do special things for me
Like, for example, ask me if I'm mad at    you (very reassuring because I was right about to ask YOU)
And today, I    was kind of waiting and waiting to see if you would call, because I was    kind of just waiting there for you
except for when I'm at swimming
A little while ago I was thinking of giving you my extra schedule, but I    figured that would be kind of
queer, don't you think
So
all in all the entire point of this was      A
substitute a phone call -parents are mad (mine and yours), and my        brother is on already      B
DON'T worry- im not leaving, cheating, or telling the truth about        pretty much anything
which is why you have guilt on you side
and        sexiness beyond belief
meow      C
And also, rock on midterms
D
Oh yeah
guilt is bad
E
And one more thing, now you have a LOT of background into parts of my        life
but sadly its still only scratching the surface     Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh and guess what     I was thinking of you     Aren't you proud of me     And maybe one LAST THING: I started off by saying that we pretty much only    worry when we're afraid of losing something
Hmmm
what made me worry, I wonder     Don't ponder too long, Midterm's awaiting
11:38 PM me: go back and play blockles
sil3nt
si1ver: ahh       but       i've been playing
si1ver: i had no idea you were in the game
11:39 PM me: it was hurtful :(      sil3nt
si1ver: and i said that that game was my last one      me: lol      sil3nt
si1ver: seriously

si1ver: they started this week       its not that bad      me: i kind of wanted to     11:43 PM sil3nt
si1ver: but

si1ver: aw     11:44 PM well       you'll just have to work harder this up coming fall semester      me: oh       i meant       take things that arecompletely out of my major       like       philosophy     11:45 PM or, something fun       like trees
sil3nt
si1ver: why
thats like throwing money away      me:
11:46 PM and the rest of college is so much better
I haven't learned ANYTHING
woot      sil3nt
si1ver: ok       lol       then take summer classes next summer       you can still take summer classes     11:47 PM there are two more sessions after this one      me: and, according to my brother, the sum of everything else mech eng

sil3nt
si1ver: oh       i thought there was a third      me: me too
11:52 PM (budget cuts)       lol      sil3nt
si1ver: haha     +-------------+    || 23 minutes |    +-------------+     12:16 AM me: hey hanna
i need help with something       are you busy right now
sil3nt
si1ver: sure       not really       i'll see if it something i can help you with      me: were you planning on sleeping anytime soon
it could
take some time
12:17 AM well       ok       so
let's start with something      sil3nt
si1ver: i was gonna sleep at 1ish       ok      me: umm       well, we're both adults      sil3nt
si1ver: ok      me: how old are you
12:18 AM sil3nt
si1ver: uh       18      me: ok cool
perfect       so
for one, do you feel that you know yourself pretty well, or really not    at all      sil3nt
si1ver: what do you mean by that
if you mean i know what i want and don't want     12:19 AM then yes       my likes and dislikes       then yes again      me: well, lately, (like, the last two years) it's become obvious to me       that i really have very little idea of who i am       and that i'm just now developing the skills that will let me figure it    out       but
also, by now, i've established my whole self
in terms of my    actions     12:20 AM so
basically, my body is much much older than my mind      sil3nt
si1ver: ok      me: and that bothers me
because now i consider them separate       like
putting on a sweatshirt when i feel sick       will make it go away       but if i just feel sick, i generally don't know why     12:21 AM and if putting on a sweatshirt doesnt fix it
i don't know what    will       that's a bad example      sil3nt
si1ver: yeah
sorry the sweatshirt thing lost me      me: ok       something
less specific     12:22 AM well, i suspect that i may be a terrible person       but i'm not sure       because, clearly I don't want to do "evil"       but i have a very vauge notion of what it is       and a lot of the things i have not problem with, are considered immoral     12:23 AM sil3nt
si1ver: by problem       you mean       oh i don't care if someone i know does this evil deed       or are you doing it yourself
me: well      sil3nt
si1ver: and you're saying i don't have a problem with it because    i'm the one doing it     12:24 AM me: more like, this thing is considered wrong, but i don't feel    that it is       and i can't exactly figure out why people would say it is       and also, i think of biases a lot       for example, to a lot of christian groups, gay people are wrong       but not to me     12:25 AM and i think everyone's just biased       and the more i think about it, there is not really a good and evil      sil3nt
si1ver: ok       murder      me: but this becomes more dangerous, when i think of murder       geez
reading my mind      sil3nt
si1ver: yeah       i do that a lot       but continue      me: well       hold on a sec     12:26 AM ok       so
in general, would you say that murder is evil      sil3nt
si1ver: yes       but     12:27 AM generally       this is without all the well       this is what happened to lead up to the murder      me: exactly
so, would you murder someone if your life depended on it
sil3nt
si1ver: no      me: if MANY lives depended on it
sil3nt
si1ver: i'd hope someone else would do it instead     12:28 AM me: ok, what if the person wanted you to       and also had no friend, family or other people that would feel sad later      sil3nt
si1ver: why would he want me to murder in the first place
whats the reason for it
to save someone(s) life/lives
12:29 AM me: no, it is simply that this person would either kill you and    many others       or you would kill him       or her      sil3nt
si1ver: why can't you knock him out then let someone else deal    with him/her      me: hmmmm     12:30 AM i guess, generally options always exist       but in this ridiculous situation, there are only two options      sil3nt
si1ver: thats lame      me: yes       also, he is ruthless and ugly      sil3nt
si1ver: then its not realistic     12:31 AM i wouldn't be able to give you an answer then      me: generally, in math and science, things are as unrealistic as possible       to get to the truth       the objective is to have only a single variable      sil3nt
si1ver: then you can't apply it     12:32 AM because its not realistic      me: like
in physics, we take away gravity, magnetism, air friction,    whatever, to figure out how it works       then add it in later     12:33 AM For this question, eliminate the variables of personal    attachement of the murdered, and any other options besides you kill him,    or he kills everyone      sil3nt
si1ver: ok       well
we're all going to die at one point or another       and its a form of population control       so
eh      me: hmmmmmm     12:34 AM i just found
a problem      sil3nt
si1ver: there are many problems right now
me: lol       yeah       but the most important one       is that, in a question that is about morality and human nature,       it doesn't really make sense to eliminate those variables
grrrrr     12:35 AM sil3nt
si1ver: yeah      me: in a perfectly logical world
murder would be one of many options    that are equally weighted for their simple pros and cons
inner monolouge
etc
etc
12:36 AM i hate everything      sil3nt
si1ver: don't hate everything      me: hmmm       well       i don't hate you
yay
12:37 AM sil3nt
si1ver: thats good       i guess      me: well, anyway       about murder       i feel like
it's interesting       and i'm very curious to see what it's like       except that all sorts of very
cold reasons are stopping me     12:38 AM sil3nt
si1ver: uh yeah      me: but i think, that it'll be similar to fighting      sil3nt
si1ver: so you're going to fight
me: in that, it interests me, but if it happens, i won't like the thought    of it at all       no, erik is fascinated with fighting       and so am i      sil3nt
si1ver: oh      me: so we decided to fight, but still be friends      sil3nt
si1ver: like physical fighting or     12:39 AM me: and i didn't like the thought of hitting him      sil3nt
si1ver: like with words
ok      me: like punching      sil3nt
si1ver: physical it is      me: well, it turns out       i'm not very stong       and also, i am incapable of hitting him as hard as I can       for emotional reasons      sil3nt
si1ver: right     12:40 AM me: i think murder will be very much like that      sil3nt
si1ver: ok      me: but
do you ever reach a point, where you say to yourself "this is    a terrible idea, but I will do it anyway, despite how much I will not want    to do it"
12:41 AM running cross country
trains you to do this sort of thing       and i think it's very bad for me       morally       to be able to bend momentary limits       but
everyone else is fine with it
actually aided by it       like: studying     12:42 AM sil3nt
si1ver: ok       right      me: and because of this
studying is analagous to murder/doing evil      sil3nt
si1ver: but it has rewards/benefits       what does murdering/fighting give you
not much      me: well       you learn      sil3nt
si1ver: learn what
me: doesnt it bother you
that we think we are very different than    murderers
12:43 AM generally
sil3nt
si1ver: you can get the same thing from a self defense class or by    learning a fighting style       i just think murders don't have enough control       they can man up and take it       same with suicide       *can't     12:44 AM me: what about
those who plan to murder       for sport
sil3nt
si1ver: hunting and stuff
i don't approve      me: no
murder
sil3nt
si1ver: it is murder       you're murdering animals      me: for eating
fishing      sil3nt
si1ver: i just try not to think of it when i'm eating      me: is not considered evil
12:45 AM sil3nt
si1ver: ok       bottom line       you can't get away from it       yes       its true       but you have to discipline yourself       /others      me: i never thought of farming and fishing in comparision to hunting      sil3nt
si1ver: lol     12:46 AM me: hmmmm       what about       mad scientist sorts of things       like the A-bomb
sil3nt
si1ver: ok what about it
should they have done it
12:47 AM i don't think they should've bombed japan      me: something like that       well       war was happening regardless
so murder was happening regardless       how about
12:48 AM damn       there's no real life things that have happened       like what i'm thinking of       ok       so
you know that robots are going to take over the world, eventually       because of the singularity
si1ver: uh       i guess
me: i'll give you a brief version       basically, human growth in technology is exponential       started off at a crawl       then kind of rocketed off       and still is rocketing off     12:50 AM eventually, technology will be sufficiently advanced to make us    want to replace ourselves       with better parts       that let us think better      sil3nt
si1ver: ok      me: which let us get to the next step better       etc
etc
until strong AI happens, and suddenly everything is robots     12:51 AM umm
would you, if you had the choice, skip the rest of humanity, and replace    it with something "better"       first, where better means in every way      sil3nt
si1ver: no     12:52 AM i think it would be a very ugly world      me: and secont, if better means in every way, except that it is no longer    "feeling"      sil3nt
si1ver: human life is about making mistakes       living and then learning from them      me: but
think of how efficient it would be
if you made every past    mistake at the moment of birht      sil3nt
si1ver: what good is a better processor for a brain if you lose    other stuff too      me: and learned all past lessons, with a single keystroke     12:53 AM you know that bridge in cook/douglass       that goes over that road
every time i cross it, i feel like it's wasting my brain away     12:54 AM sil3nt
si1ver: why
me: because every time i cross it, i think of how wierd it is that each    step is exactly a step up, then a step on the step, then the next step up       and i know that everyone else has had a similar experience, unless they    have significantly shorter legs     12:55 AM and
if you took every second that we thought that same thought       from every person       and put it to good use
we would have a lot less of a waste of time     12:56 AM sil3nt
si1ver: thats true      me: and every person, who has ever had the same of any thought,       which is a lot of different connections, over many years, in many minds,    in many places     12:57 AM will simply know that to be true, and move on to different things       at least, it seems like a good idea to me     12:58 AM except for the fact that, those types of things       are exactly what i live for      sil3nt
si1ver: then its a good thing that we don't have computers for    brains       so you can enjoy those moments       who care if you're wasting time       as along as you're enjoying it     12:59 AM i'm sorry but i'm gonna go to sleep      me: ok       good night     1:00 AM I feel as though this was just an example of me needing someone to    talk to
and unfortunately wasting your time       sorry      sil3nt
si1ver: no       you weren't wasting my time       you shouldn't feel that way       you should thing       *think     1:01 AM well       i don't know what you should think       but its not that       :D       night
me: goodnight     Arg, and I didn't even get to the increasingly relevant subject of the    possibility of me being the most selfish person that I know
That sentence    infuriates me
its existence is pretty damning evidence
Lexi     so question
2:31pmJeffrey     yes
2:31pmLexi     you like elise, right
2:32pmJeffrey     of course
who doesn't like elise
2:33pmLexi     no, but i mean like LIKE like
not just like
2:44pmJeffrey     hey, what's the deal
how come you get to spy for her but not for me
yo, does elise like me
2:45pmLexi     i will spy for you and her both
so you have to answer my question
2:46pmJeffrey     i like elise a lot, but the fact that she's a sophomore in HS kind of bugs    me and my family, which i have told that we are going out     because i was pretty positive that we were     is that good
lots of information in a tight package, also including phrasing that    adequately communicates my mindset     2:47pmLexi     yes
i will not tell her and find out how she feels
2:47pmJeffrey     oh, i was just messing with you     i'm pretty positive she likes me     i'm pretty positive she likes me     or at least, likes me enough that we can have a relationship for the    moment     and after that, it really doesn't matter     2:47pmLexi     JERK
2:48pmJeffrey     jerk
2:48pmLexi     so you are saying that you are basically just using her
2:48pmJeffrey
what are you reading
i meant that, with relationships, you sort of move day by day     nobody knows with these things     2:48pmLexi     "i'm pretty positive she likes me     or at least, likes me enough that we can have a relationship for the    moment     and after that, it really doesn't matter     "     thats what i was reading
2:48pmJeffrey
i don't get it     how does that mean i'm using her
it means that i don't know what tomorrow is going to be like     only today     maybe next week she finds out something she doesn't really like     or tomorrow, her parents disapprove so strongly that they won't let her go    out anymore     or, after a few weeks of dating, we find out we're just not that into each    other     we don't know these things     we only know that today we will be going out, and find more about    eachother     2:51pmLexi     so you are not using her just to get action
2:51pmJeffrey     and that is all     i am not using her just to get action     we were close friends before now, and friends don't do that to each other     unless
one is really depressed, and you decide that it might be healthy    to give him a little present to cheer him up     (which is something you should do more often :P, lots of guys would really    enjoy it)     2:52pmLexi     i am sure they would
haha     2:52pmJeffrey     ok, so we are all on the same page now, and you don't think i'm using    elise shamelessly
and we're agreed that i'm NOT a horrible person, except that she's a    little young
2:53pmLexi     no
i dont think that
2:53pmJeffrey     hmm
what does no mean     this is kind of importatnt to be clear on     (no means NO jeff
2:55pmJeffrey     lol that's nice to konw     but i'm still bothered by the "no i don't think that" phrase     2:57pmLexi     y
2:57pmJeffrey     ok, so we are all on the same page now, and you don't think i'm using    elise shamelessly
no     2:58pmLexi     correct
2:58pmJeffrey     so
we are not on the same page
2:58pmLexi     OMG
do you know what you are saying
2:58pmJeffrey     no
wait, so you still think i am a horrible person
2:59pmLexi     yes we are on the same page, and no i dont thin kthat you are using her
2:59pmJeffrey     yay
great     we are all perfect     unless you are just saying that     2:59pmLexi     ok cool
i wasnt just saying that     :)     2:59pmJeffrey     AWESOME
unless you are just saying THAT     oh geez     online is a horrible place to have serious conversations     also, you are a terrific actress in person     and i was so excited because you said we were all going back to elises's    to make out that one time     3:00pmLexi     no
i wasnt just saying that i was jsut saying that
3:00pmJeffrey     and you were just lying     3:00pmLexi     and i was acting
haha     3:01pmJeffrey     well, it's either acting     or being really good at lying     3:01pmLexi     both
cuz i usually blush when i lie
3:02pmJeffrey     but you also blush when you publicly announce you are going to make out    with two people at once     so, it was TERRIFIC acting
i am horribly confused now     emotionally as well
i need to relax     for a bit     and i need a hug     wtf     you're a jerk     3:03pmLexi     sorry
That's what the great thing about school is
Once you're done with the year, you probably never have to deal with that    teacher again
You can look straight at them, have them know that you see    them, and just turn the fuck away
The second they know you saw them, you    can just look away an laugh to yourself
Confident that even though you    have no intention of acknowledging their presence, you know they're there    and they see you
Confident that you can be an utter ass to them and get    away with it
What are they going to do
I often criticize people in my mind about getting really touchy when I do    a mean joke on them, and doing a minor retaliation
But I do the same    thing
I wish I could stop
The best I can do is just try to remember to    let it go
When junk like that happens

Abby called
Couldn't hear a damn thing
Promised I would call her back
Still haven't
I don't like shopping
Or talking in cars
Laura's little chat and a bump on the side
Orgasm footmassage
I practically screamed out in agonizing joy
People    thought I was weird
In a facebook note: (dreamed up by the microwave, but never posted)     Is there any way to polite way to tell someone that it's just not working    out, and you never want to hear from them
Is there some RIGHT way to do    that
If it's just a hassle to try to be their friend, and you want to    just slip away into anonymity
Also, since this is an entirely hypothetical situation, is there any RIGHT    way to convince all your friends that ask "is it me
That might be a problem in the near future
12/9/07 Sunday     "Hey Abby, sorry I didn't call you back
It's just when I got home I was    so tired I couldn't really think
I ran out of battery
so I just shoved it in a    charger and went to bed
is this about my sister
I've decided I'm in a very good place
We're all three in a very    good place
where I can get UNLIMITED hugging privileges
and absolutely no emotional attachment
It's very nice
ummm that's nice
It's good to not have    that problem
Why wouldn't I be
I didn't think it was really fair to call you    when I knew I couldn't hang out or anything
blowing her off is    more fair
Well
all the stuff I didn't tell you about last time we    talked
How it's so hard for me to    just be single because of Marissa
No
I don't really blame her
Is it    like this for you
He never calls back when he says    he will
I was going to take a nap
You can join me if    you want
When I came to visit her this morning, I    had an emotional time
The phrases "incredible delight" and "cutesy    hugfest" and also "awkwardly cuddling in the middle of the hall, but    ignoring everyone me and her" describe my experience
Swim team party: Lexi is getting a lot of attention
She's very cuddly,    and quite alright with her "teddy bear" status
Apparently, Elise is also    very ok with my habits
Because I was setting the three of us up so I'd be    completely surrounded by soft goodness, and she actually got up and    changed seats when I motioned to her
I was quite surprised (and for the    record, being surrounded by soft goodness
is soft goodness
Quite a    fine time
I didn't know what/where Dartmouth was
So    instead of saying "congratulations" I asked those questions
She was    pretty pissed
I was pretty sorry
Today was supposed to be the Trenton meet
Sarah was supposed to come film    us
I was really nervous about it
On the one hand, she might like me    without much clothes
Maybe after watching me swim she'd suddenly swoon    and inexplicably want me
On the other hand, maybe not
And I'd feel like    a fool around her
Especially without any clothes
I felt lonely at lunch
And sick
I've been having a lot of weird things    going on with myself lately
I can smell a strangely large amount of    things recently
Pretty potently too
So I took a walk
I took a tour of    the 300 hall, and sat that the desk at the T
I was thinking about how    strange it felt
Feeling a little more free, and mostly just strange
Wanting to be more liberated from everyone else, though I could still hear    the echoes
It would be nice if Sasha and Sarah wouldn't sit on my mind    too
And if my Physics lab were done
Then I came back, and sat next to    Mrs
Barzilai
She wondered if everything was alright, and they were
The    bell rang, and we stared out into space
She moved off
Sasha walked past, bringing me back to this world
Suddenly having to deal    with her presence made me feel scared - irrationally self conscious as    always
I settled back down and suddenly Sarah was right there, walking    towards me
We went down the stairs, I was still quiet,    and trying to settle into her hand
Every time I'm with her, I wish the    world would slow down, and reality would bend itself just for us
And    things would be soft and flexible, and instead of holding her hand down    the hall, we were snuggled together on a couch
I suddenly felt a lot    better
It's dangerous to get too attached to her
I stopped, and gently tried to    break free
She held on to my one finger, and gently pulled back
I remember thinking it was one of the sweetest things anyone could do
I also remember feeling suddenly as if half of me took a step back into my    mind
leaving it's last words "I can make myself that person
if you    want me to
Whenever I'm choosing one girl over another, I always feel totally weird    about it
Like I don't want to exclude everyone else
Maybe that's why I    felt strangely when Sasha walked past
Because I knew I was waiting there    for Sarah
As I held Sarah's hand, Amanda appeared around the corner
I felt a flood    of confused emotion swirl through me
Luckily, someone vandalized the GSA sign, and we stopped to fix it
GA'S
G-A
A GA
What is it
And why was it on the board
I got it
This is really embarrassing"    "Well, usually, when something is spelled `GAS' its gas
Some people
I stopped suddenly
feeling as if somehow I ruined something
I felt the    proximity to her slip away
Bye Sarah
Hypothetical, abstract situation follows
Be warned
The chance that you get the flu is highly dependent on the number of    people that get it around you
So, if every single person you know is 100%    fine every year, should you really bother to get the flu shot
Probably    not
why bother, when your individual chance of getting it is super low
You hardly contact the virus at all in your daily activities
Odd's are,    none of you is getting the flu, unless some jerk picks it up from a friend    outside of your circle, and drags it into the circle (unlikely,    considering past experience)     (I also feel like i should bring up: what if the reason you and your    friends aren't getting sick is because everyone always gets the flu    shot
And you decide to just ride on their healthiness and save a few    bucks by skipping the flu shot
9/10 times you can just mooch like this,    but what about the 1 time that everyone has that thinking, and all of you    get hella sick
doesn't that suck
It makes perfect sense,    everything follows a logical flow
But, FOR ME, I'd definitely get the flu shot
Why take a meaningless    chance
Especially if everyone is offered to get a flu shot at absolutely    no cost, besides filling out a registration form
I would vote for my big-party candidate over a third-party candidate even    if everyone else was
because I want to MAKE SURE (or at least do my    part to make sure) that my state will not be a major upset
But
If this is not your primary argument, I think I saw another one
If everyone found their individual BEST candidate, the whole game would    change
So
Everyone go do that now
The way I see it, this is a two step process
First: on a limited scale,    people in "safe" states, where one candidate is obviously going to win,    because of the undefined and ever present "everyone else"
Then, once    third parties get national attention, the whole game changes and everyone    breaks down to find their individual best
Not done yet past this point     Ok
Since we're in stage one, I shouldn't bother with stage two
Also, the    current party system has two "teams"
If you vote for a third party, then    you don't get the strength of a "team" to back you up
What I think would work better is if each party split itself into a few    different people, each with slightly separate
Siris and his wind -it does NOT blow from the    north east, "Cold Sir
If you think about them too much you forget    how to do them
About a Handsome Prince, and a princess
and a    castle
I don't really have any
Why don't you tell me a story
You're a    pretty good storyteller
really
And plus, it was cold
Everything seemed in    some way wrong, and sideways
That's something that's been on my mind for    a while now
In simplest terms, the only logical outcome of my third    belief is that I am dangerous
The third belief states that "something, in    some way, is terribly wrong"
As I see it, there are three logical results    of this
1) I'm just being paranoid
In that case, and this is stated to    be on of my highest beliefs, then something is broken within me
Something    that will probably get worse
Something that makes me not a good person to    hang around with
The second result takes this into account
I'm right
but only locally
Something is terribly wrong with ME
In that case I'm    personally dangerous
I would be in some way different
No good could come    from being in contact with someone like that, except for some new    perspectives
The third possible outcome is that things are terribly    wrong, and then we are all broken
And we waited in the silence and the cold for    something to happen
Nothing did
Not for a long time
But I did move on    to drawing pictures and organizing my thoughts
Generally, it's pretty    hard for me to concentrate without motions and visuals and notes
I for    some reason like to try to multiply large numbers in my head
But I don't    do it like normal people, or at least what I imagine most people do
Ordinarily, people would multiply straight through as if they were doing    it on paper
The full steps of a long multiplication table stack up and    are summed at the end
But I don't work like that
I grab one number,    whichever is more convenient, and prime-factorize it
I then take the    other number, and start stacking up the prime factors
The most recent one I did was how many seconds are in a day: 24x 3600
I like doing them this way for    two reasons
A) It's easier for me
I've always liked to factorize    numbers, except when it gets really hard (7, 13, or more) B) It's more    fun
Prime factors are always interesting, and by doing it this way, it    feels as if you're speeding up and going faster and faster and faster    until it's hard to keep your eyes open and you think your heart will    explode
It's almost like you're concentrating your entire being on    building and building and building within yourself and you have to focus    everything on a singular goal
The tension rises until your body is    consumed by it, each factor being added on takes you to a new level of    intensity
And then, when you do the last one, where does it all go
It    just fizzles into thin air, as if you hadn't been doing anything at all
All that's left is an answer you're not sure is right
So, I left
With a paper that had a few jotted down notes on it
Pieces of    memories and thoughts
A few pictures that didn't mean anything
Things    that weren't fully connected yet
And as I walked off, it started to pour
And things became blurred and wet    and cold
But much cleaner
And then everything was clear
And I jotted    down some more notes, and had a story left behind
Once upon a time, there was a young prince who had just inherited a piece    of his father's kingdom
As he was sent away to his new castle, his father    gave him a magic looking glass
He was given no instructions on how to    rule, or how to live his life
He was never told what his duties were, or    what he was meant to accomplish
The only thing he knew was that if he    ever needed anything, his mother and father were always there, but he had    to make a new life for himself
So, after he had settled in, he looked to the magic mirror
The mirror    simply showed his reflection
The prince stared deep into the mirror
The mirror stared back
The prince inspected the mirror's golden frame
It seemed to be, in every    way, an ordinary mirror
The only difference that he could tell was that    this mirror was much more expensive than an ordinary mirror, and was kept    extraordinarily clean
Then    blinked and smiled
The blink was of obvious confusion and the smile    carried a hint of shame
The prince was startled by this
He hadn't meant to show his feelings to    the mirror
He put his hand to his face to check that he didn't have the    wry, bashful smile he saw in his reflection
The reflection's face    darkened as its hand also rose, and the illusion once more matched the    prince
Suddenly, they both smiled at each other
They beamed at each other with    sudden pride
The mirror showed the prince's emotions much more truthfully    than he had even known himself
And so, for some time, the prince was happy and satisfied
His small    corner of the world began to grow and flourish, to the delight of his    parents, and every time he looked into his mirror, he saw a smiling prince    looking back
THIS STORY COULD END    HERE, OR BREAK INTO OTHER DIRECTIONS
The    young princess didn't seem very interested
Strange things began happening to his reflection (as the prince pined away    for his uncaring love)
At first, the reflection was dancing and jumping    as the prince walked past
Even the golden frame seemed to shine more    brilliantly from his ardent love
However, as time wore on, and his feelings were still not reciprocated, he    began to feel ignored
Every now and then, as he walked past the mirror,    he would miss is reflection for a second, and only find it with a second    of scrutiny
The reflection was almost transparent, only becoming visible    when sought for
The princess remained oblivious to his presence, and the reflection went    mad with the rejection
His image was always seen doubled over, screaming    in agony and clutching its head
It thrashed about as it wailed within its    gilded prison
As the lovesick days turned to weeks, and weeks into months, the    reflection seemed to beat itself down
From the raging insanity, it    settled to anxious pacing, then leaned against the furnishings, depressed
Without even the slightest attentions from the princess, the reflection    finally seemed to have given up, and sat on the ground in a tired, wholly    un-prince-like manner
It was a sad sight for the prince to see, and he    felt even more depressed every day
until one day
the reflection    vanished
When he first noted the reflection's absence, he stopped, confused
He    pressed his nose to the mirror and searched every inch of the reflected    room
He even called out to his reflection, begging it to return
The    prince was quite alarmed
He was also too depressed and confused to do    anything about it
The prince sat down before the mirror, despite how un-prince-like it was,    sighed deeply and said to himself "That's it
This is the end of me
That    young princess stole my soul
The    reflection gave an angry face and urged on the prince
Both the prince and his reflection were now furious
They stormed out of    their respective rooms furiously muttering to themselves and giving    intermittent shouts as they hurried to their stables
The prince's    servants were all quite afraid, and quickly readied his horse
Never had    they seen their generally cheerful, if lovesick, master act with malice
The prince took off on his steed, and rode across the land
He rode at a    full gallop on the dusty dirt road that led to the next castle
The sun    was setting over the castle that lay before him, and the hot summer day    doggedly clung to the earth
They flew smoothly across the land, the skill    and speed of the prince being enhanced by his ferocious, unrelenting    anger
The rapid pace of the horse's gallop was music to fit the racing    thoughts in the prince's mind
His anger
The prince mounted powerfully and dramatically
He swung up    onto his mount in a single, smooth motion, reared up and then burst out of    his stables at a full gallop
The road was hot and dusty, but the prince    and his steed flew smoothly, as if his anger was a fuel to push them    along
He leapt off his tired horse and stormed inside the castle
Servants, shaking in fear, stepped aside (and opened the doors on his    way
The sky is blood red as the sun sets over the castle, and the prince    storms inside, his footsteps heavy and even, letting all who hear them    know of his anger
Servant swarm about him, paving the way, and their    frantic bee-like buzzing only seem to be physical extensions of his    malicious intent
It was as if his anger controlled their minds, and they    became weapons of destruction, pushing open door, shoving gaurds to the    side, making sure that nothing came between the prince and his objectives
Mirrors     You know what bothers me
Mirrors
What color is a mirror
I was really puzzled by this
I mean, I was puzzled by what a random question it was and why my brain    decided to pose it completely randomly, but more importantly, I was    puzzled the very question
What color IS a mirror
Think about it
All you see in a mirror is your reflection
On a good mirror, that's all    you see
So I got thinking
does it HAVE a color
What's the definition of color
I guess it would be the frequency of visible light that is reflected
so    technically it would be white
I mean, white is the sum of all the colors
White light has everything
But wait
what if the object in the background is black
Then your    mirror is black
Hmm
That's pretty messed up
So I came up with another idea
Mirrors are just
no color at all
But then what is it
I think one of the main problems here is that I don't know what mirrors    are made up of
So
what if I took a mirror and started scraping down little layers    from the back to the front
What would I see
Would the last real color
be the color of the mirror
But what if it turns a different color because I'm scratching down layers
Or what if
it doesn't have any color
That would really suck
But then what would it look like
Can you imagine something without color
Would every mirror be
like a black hole on the other side
But what about those two way mirrors
Hmmm
Well, that's no good
then Mirrors might be see through
But if mirrors are see through, then you'll see right through them
and    then you obviously have to hit something to get the reflection
So what    color is that
So I'm back where I started
then I started thinking of other things    that reflect
TV's reflect
but I know they're black
So
maybe mirrors are black
But Really shiny cars can be any color they want
and they'll reflect
So
what is it
Then I started getting all geeky and nerdy and mathy
all at the same    time
If the color of the mirror is the set of colors that will reflect off of    it
then the set for the mirror would be all colors
I mean
mathematically I'm right
and that sort of goes along with my    first idea
But what about if you put a mirror in a blue room
Then it looks blue
Sigh
there were cavemen
Cavemen hunted and gathered, and everything they needed to live
and    that's just the way it was
They were just animals basically
And then
some bratty little caveman child didn't feel like hunting or    gathering that day
so he (or she) opened his (or her) little caveman    mouth and said "why
Why isn't there an easier way
Why
mostly things were just
done
There was no "why
So the question is this
Was the first person to ever grunt out a dissatisfied "why
OR was it a good thing    everything is so much better now-a-days
because, as Einstein said "The    important thing is not to stop questioning
Dancing     Relationships are kind of like dancing
Or, at least the best ones are
In a beautiful, slow, romantic waltz, the two slide hand in hand across    the floor
They work together, they're synchronized, and they can continue    in their dance for quite some time
The dance is steady and structured,    but at the same time lively
It gives the two a great opportunity to get    lost in each other, balancing the slowness to enjoy the other's company    and the speed to prevent boredom
It's perfect
But often the steps are    too tricky to hold on to, and for many it's too slow, and works    irregularly with the body
In a relationship, its probably not the wisest to be a contemporary, where    the idea is to find someone, and both of you stop, grind with each other,    feeling the other's body for physical reasons, and expect everything to    work well
For one
nobody's going to hold a relationship like that    forever
the very nature of it is to live in the moment, stopping with    the partner on a fixed place in the dance floor
There's no time to enjoy    the other on the same level as a waltz would have, where the two would    look deep into the other's eyes and ascend from the physical
But
that's the world now I guess
At the same time it does no good to just sprint across the room with your    partner
Nor to hold them in a loving embrace in one spot
You can't    expect to fly in the elation of drugs with them eternally
Holding hands    and walking
Well, it seems alright to me
but could be better I    guess
Well, I don't know how to waltz, but it would be nice if I did
Interesting memories
Friday 10/17/08 -Freshman year of college, before    Homecoming, during the XC Brown Trip and Sarah Coops's Birthday
Gahh, such purposeful hypocrisy is confusion
We should all stop it    possibly
Especially the contractions
Well, let's start at the beginning
It was a Thursday, so therefore I was up to strange times of night doing    my Expos Paper
Unfortunately, this time stranger things happened
For    one, trying to do a Day-extender didn't work too well at all, and was done    in the first floor Nook, so lots of people got really confused and freaked    out
Also, I went to bed with only half a paper done, because I was too tired    to go on
And then
I Overslept my alarm
And so
had only about an    hour in the morning to finish before I had to get to my Calc test
Whiteboard notes:     Interesting memories:     "don't be a creep, don't be a acreep
Shit
and being totally confused
Do you party
Hey Sasha
this is the root of    interesting memories
Meeting permanent strangers
9/6/09     Should I maybe focus more on the storytelling aspect, or the conveyal of    important emotional responses and thoughts
In other words, should I am to be interesting, or to show what I consider    to be interesting
Hopefully
both
But I would rather move much more towards the act of showing emotion, than    to creating an interesting story
even at a 2:1 cost
Probably even to a    1000:1 cost
My current methods aren't very efficient
Also, when talking to Spiros about the girls I met in Asia (Shan Jiang and    Melodie Wong
also my cousin
Especially    trying to arrange the possibility of being with them temporarily
It is simply not too appealing
Probably for them as well
But here at Rutgers, I'm beginning to feel this way about everyone
Why    bother talking to these transient people
This is exactly the wrong attitude
But, the ancient question comes up again
Should I fight my nature for profit, or stay true to myself
I would love    to be loved
Even temporarily
And the only way to find the one, may be to    find and eliminate those who are not her
But I should probably not compromise myself with a devastated past
That    remains true
And what if we're meant to be because of my truth to my own    way
Isn't it true that happiness is the reward for patience and    determination through seemingly endless sorrow
Maybe
I should stop believing that too
It makes me sad to even consider

sprint though    Multiple choice sections and then use the remaining time to recheck    answers; take your time on each of them (just take however long it takes    to answer them, and skip ones that seem impossible); take your time in the    beginning then slowly get faster and faster; or use "perfect pacing"

Write:     Summer 08
Ancient: dystopian future
Criminal/ex-convict/insane guy takes    a drug that is hailed as a miracle drug of the future
Eternal life
In    lab testing, any animal given the drug experienced a lifespan of 5 times    the normal, increased resistance to disease (though not immune), and    slightly improved regenerative capabilities
The downside, when given in    humans, they do live for a much longer time (the lifespan has yet to be    determined, as none of the subjects have died to natural causes), but    slowly become depressed, homicidal, insane, ridiculously sarcastic, and    generally disillusioned by the world
The protagonist talks about    depressive crap all the time as he wanders from place to place, trying to    find hope in the world
Along the way, he occasionally meets those who, like him, have taken the    drug (now banned in every part of the world), all of which experience    similar symptoms
Many of them have committed suicide, become murderers,    rapists, or lunatics
The protagonist has a lot of hallucinations, slowly    getting worse, and frequent nightmares, from which he awakes perfectly    calmly
He explains that the nightmares had always been there
He was    insane before the drug, and now doesn't know the difference between what's    him and what's the drug
Which parts of his insanity are natural
Which    parts of the depression are him, the world or the drug

This was not the way    the world was meant to be
10/1/08     In Ancient, the effected people will have to deal with the "what if their    appearance becomes lacking
or worse still, crippled, scarred, or with some sort of daily    pain (would arthritis build forever
What about drug addictions for all    time
Fear of getting close to "mortals", or people with    normal life spans- contributes to their endless wandering
Also, since most of the wealthiest people in the world got it (the drug),    then killed themselves, many of the world's issues have been solved
It was incredibly rare to find people    starving, or with malaria/typhus/whatever, since aid for those things were    so readily available
The world's current problems were limited to lack of    housing, pollution, and the new totalitarian states that had emerged
Many of these families were open to the idea, but    chose not to take the drug for personal reasons
Other families, however,    began to disown any children that took the drug, establishing an extremely    strict and hostile stance against the idea of eternal life
These    families, already rich and powerful before the release of _____drug    name___, were now gods in comparison to most others
It seemed ironic that    the reward for refusing God's eternal life was to become a god among men
Left unchallenged, totalitarian, almost feudal regimes began    to spring up across the globe
And in the end, they were    right

ahem, moving on
Jeffrey63090 [3:58 PM]: It all begins with me and Atwal
One day it seems    we are doing an obnoxiously boring review with everybody misbehaving
Mostly it was not me, as I was on the brink of snoozing off in the back
Soon thereafter, and unfortunate chain of events lead up to my second    referral to the office
After quieting the crowd of unruly, and wide    awake,    Jeffrey63090 [3:58 PM]: students, Mrs
Goldman becomes fed up with the    group
Jeffrey63090 [3:58 PM]: "Do you want to do this individually, or as a    group" -she asks    A total and complete silence fills the crowd
Jeffrey63090 [3:59 PM]: "Ok
Apparently my right hand is disobedient to both Mrs
Goldman as well as myself, as it was the first to rocket into the air
Seeing as Atwal was closer, she refers to him first
Quieting my voice to    an almost in audible murmur, I continue with one of those great comebacks    that always go unused
After possibly three minutes of mind-numbing boredom and whining to each    other, we bring a new form of entertainment to the world
It wasn't    exactly smart, or new at all
In fact, every person who has asked me about    this event called me a retard, or at least stupid
Here's how it all went down
Jeffrey63090 [3:59 PM]: "Hey, there' a lot of space back here, know what    we could do

Jeffrey De Lucca                                                                   AP Lit Final     On a darkened stage, in a small, quiet town a single beam of light shines    down on a simple three legged table
The stain is plain, but the quiet,    patiently waiting table seems to shine with an eerie brightness
The    audience is completely silent as slow, heavy footfalls are heard from the    left
A foot enters the beam of light slowly, the leather shoe shining as    it clicks down to the ground once more in steady rhythm
A solemn,    dignified man enters the beam of light to stand beside his stool
Dressed    in a plain black and white tuxedo, he faces his audience with a face that    seems to be made of stone
A series of    flawless illusions, each more breathtaking than the last, were performed    onstage
The faces of the audience were bright with shock and disbelief
They gasped in awe as the magician worked the laws of reality into    submission to his whim
But the more impressed they were with him and his    illusions, the more unhappy he seemed
Each round of applause seemed to    bring a wave of sadness, until he seemed on the verge of tears
As the curtain closed before him, he put his hand on the table, and looked    out to the audience
They screamed with delight, and stood as they    applauded his skill
He sighed, and dragged his fingers on the table's    surface as he exited the stage
The table no longer shone, but seemed to    brood in silent, miserable solitude in the center of the stage
When the crowd had all gone, John Demidov exited slowly, still dressed in    his suit
Around him, there was nothing but the sounds of a small quiet    town
It was a warm summer night, and the sun would be setting in half an    hour
John began walking westward, toward the setting sun
Alone with his thoughts and rhythmic click of his shoes on pavement,    John's mind began to wander
As with any performer, his first thoughts    were of that night's show
He played back the events of the night from his perspective, taking care    to remember each and every detail
Though he knew it was impossible, his    perfectionist nature drove him to this hopeless ritual
In his mind, he    was onstage, simultaneously the performer and viewer
Able to analyze from    all perspectives, manipulate time at will, and reflect on every detail
He sighs as he once again looks out onto the crowd
As he    crosses over a bridge, he sits himself down at the edge of the stage
He    sits with the performer behind him, and the audience before him, watching    their faces grow bright with awe
My name is John Demidov, and    today, I'm going to show you some magic
None of it matters
He    sits watching the faces of the audience
mysterious
Too nervous
Too    nervous
to embellish my act with all that extra crap
Too nervous to    give them those lies about having learned pagan rituals
About sealing    pacts with the devil to gain unholy skills
About traveling to faraway    lands to learn the secrets of the dark arts
He stands with    his hand resting on the table, staring at the closed red curtain
He faces    the audience once more, and says "Hello
My name is John Demidov, and    today, I'm going to trick you
The simple table doesn't shine brilliantly or brood in    the dark
It's simply there
Even before I enter the stage, they're in the    palm of my hand
They come to be tricked
And I don't fail them
He draws the ace of    spades and puts the rest of the deck on the table
He gives the ace a wave    and it suddenly vanishes
John takes a step back from his body, and sees    the card hiding plainly behind his hand
The magician "returns" the ace,    and that night's audience suddenly roars in applause once more
John's    face darkens
From my point of view, I don't see the    cards flash in and out of existence, I see a crowd getting fooled by a    bunch of cheap tricks
Am I the only    one who cares
The setting sun    reminded him of the spotlight of the stage
When he was still performing    in Russia, he once saw the most incredible study of perspectives    imaginable
It seemed to be fate that brought him to it
Or, perhaps it was inevitable    that a sight like this would be captured one day
Perhaps because he knew    the performance on stage was all just a trick, he sought out things more    real
During a brief stint at a circus, he had discovered exactly what he    had been looking for
Something real
No lies
No deceit
No tricks
John Demidov had found a hunger artist, possibly the last of his kind
Hidden in the shadows, was a lone cage with old, faded signs
A stronger    contrast between reality and illusion could never be found, as purity of    this performance was contrasted with the cheapest of circus tricks:    charging people to see animals
Day after day I watched him in secret
He hardly    ever stirred, and certainly never ate
People would march past him, not    knowing what they saw before them
Some cruelly mocked him for the    circus's negligence in monitoring the fast, some tried hopelessly to show    the beauty of the fast, but most simply ignored him
In their eye, he was    worthless, in mine a god
In others, a relic, and in his own
John stopped his steady    march home, focused entirely on this memory
He watched as the hunger    artist grasped the overseer with his last breath, and whispered his most    sacred secrets
like me
The sun had gone down, and John was nearly home
The smell of the grass    seemed to be stirred up by his footsteps
The green of the earth brought    back memories of Ireland, where he had visited long ago
He stepped into a bazaar in Ireland
It was past 10 pm at Araby, and he    strode past dark, empty stalls
Suddenly, he saw a strange thing
A young    boy entered, inspected the wares at a pottery stall, and left
The vendor    flirted with two young men, and seemed annoyed by the interruption
The boy walked off into darkness with obvious anger and pain
He paid a shilling to enter and see one stall,    where he didn't buy anything
But he left inexplicably angry and ashamed
The pieces still didn't line up
And why would he seem so betrayed over such a trivial matter
What was he    looking for
A miracle
He sat down to rest for a    bit
He was getting old now
By his chair, he kept a deck of cards
He    began to repeat his entire stage performance in the comfort of his home
My name is John Demidov, and today, I'm going to show you some    magic
He thought of the Hunger Artist, and of the    Boy at Araby
Everything human    at least
Nothing we ever do is real
We're so far from what we should be
We're just terrible excuses for what human was meant to be
Maybe, when he's    perfect, he'll perform real magic
For what reasons would an insect crawl on you
8/12/09     For this, insects will be both personified, and considered as mindless    drones
Please don't mind the discrepancies
Ok Vincent     Think of all the reasons an insect would crawl on you     "food"     what about food     "it wants to eat food

A black blur streaks across the screen as the writer types
The soft    mechanical click is interrupted by the obvious lack of skill and practice    at the keyboard, but the words come quickly by anger
why DIDN'T I
Everything's a blur to me
Nothing makes sense
Smell is a powerful weapon when properly used
The proximity of her was    nearly enough to make him actually do what he had wanted for so long
Every day was the same, and every day was torture
For a week, he    withstood it, and now was sure he would bear a load ten times stronger for    his stupidity, his weakness, his fear

how it is     +---------------------------------------------------------+    |---------------------------------------------------------|    | Subject: | erm
Yeah
awkward
M
Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     Yes
i did "a lot" of pullups
like 6
if those were say
miles    in a really tough workout
then i would actually feel proud
but when its pullups
i just feel sad :(     lol, but that's ok
i'm better than a girl
YES
so dont pair up with me for baseball or    football or anything
moving on
you know what i mean
so yeah
horray for awkward confessions
see ya
M
Eastern Daylight Time |    +---------------------------------------------------------+     Anyway, that's a good way to put life
If I had to do that for myself I'd    say about 55% of my time is school, 45% is sports and extra curricular    stuff and 10% is social
That mean that every day, I give 110%
hahahaha
I got I kick out of that
Anyway, you happen to fall in all those categories consequently I think    about you about 88% of my time
of that 88%, ummmmmmm lets see, 87% is    thinking of what it would be like if we were still together and sorta    wishing it were true and covering it up by acting really really angry
of that 87% thinking about how I can't say I love you is about 70% (I    swear you read my mind b/c I was sorta gonna say it after the bus ride    home today and then give you a big hug but then my dad was there
17%    is thinking about how much fun we could be having if we could still hang    out
But no, 6 pull ups is a lot, that's about average
Some guys were really    good and some sucked
you shoulda seen some of the guys that went today
To make you feel better, Ben Crane didn't do any and 2 guys only did 2
Guess wha,t, I hold the record for the girls in out class
you'd be so    proud
hahaha, I can throw
well, but not with much aim
good job at the meet today, you beat Jared
Thanx for the coat, I was    really cold
yey     Really, thanx for being such a great friend

Things left on my whiteboard, before going back to School
8/29/09     We could be perfectly fine, if only we used the right coordinate system
Shit (in a box on the bottom left)     Insanity     Philosopher's dilemma     -to always think, and never know     to have emotions intertwined with logic     to be force to think forever     to wonder if there really is reason among nonsense     Because everyone's mean
In red: from walking at night     Only two things     Anger and Fear     I shouldn't be afraid of what's out there
I should be afraid of what's in    here
You continue walking, past when you think you know something
Because, if    you think you know, you are wrong
Onl return when you see that you know    nothing, and are at peace with that
The most exciting time
You know, this whole week was pretty weird
Sunday, I got stood up by Marissa (her parents being pretty weird as    usual)
The previous night I had a lot of big plans
She was going to come    over and let me teach her physics, and that usually led to a blatant lack    of studying and a basically real fun time
I was always curious
if you    feed someone chocolate right before kissing them
does it taste    chocolatey, gross or normal
Well either way, I really wanted to make    something chocolatey and delicious
I was thinking of how amazing it would    be
how perfect it would be
I was going to make Something that would    knock people down
As I drifted off to sleep Saturday night, these things    swirled in my head, like a perfect chocolate dream that would come true in    the morning, and "so win fair lady's heart" as they say
But
Things have been getting muddled recently
Since Marissa broke up    with me, the world has been fresh with so many new opportunities
In my    dreams, I thought of the more exciting application of chocolate
Rosie    hates me
I know that
But I guess I'm just stuck on her
I don't    really know why except for those amazing eyes
In the deep of the night,    all of this came together
I drifted off to school, and I had brownies
They were these beautiful, delicious treats and I gave them to all the    girls in my life
Christine's memory mingled with Rosie's and suddenly    there I was, trying to shove this gift and note at her, and just running    off, trying to hide from my feelings
Rosie's was a sad farewell
I was    giving up on her finally
It was exactly what she wanted
stop thinking    of her and just fade into a distant sort of friendship
Just sort of    disappear, just like I so often wish I could
Her friends would gather    around and they'd all read this little message trying to explain that    every time I see her I can't keep my eyes off her, but I wish I could so I    wouldn't fall out of her favor
Being a stalker fellow is never a good    thing, and she would eat this amazing brownie and I would just disappear
Then things got pretty messed up and we were on the bus, and she was    REALLY pissed
Because I gave up on her
Stupid dreams
In the Morning we had practice, but as soon as I got home, there was a    bustling kitchen with my mom working on three fruity concoctions
She was    making peach cobbler, and apple tart, and banana bread muffins
I searched    all morning through our cookie and cakes books, finding nothing that was    shockingly good
So I went to find the famous "Better Than Sex Cake II"
I found the thing, and it was all wrong
The other variations were no    better
All wrong
I searched for things that were more up my alley
Something hardcore awesome
Something so sweet it could kill
Something
with chocolate
And there it was
The Ultimate Chocolate Bar
The title    told wonders, but as I grazed through the ingredients list, I knew this    was the one
Confectioner's sugar
one of the greatest tools in making a    sweet ever invented
And then I saw it
Marshmellows
There would be Marshmellows in this    beast
I knew I had to have it
I had to make this thing
and it would    be amazing
I quickly looked it over once more to be sure I could
everything was set, everything perfect
And so I baked
When it was done
it was beautiful
it was Amazing
It made me want to cry it was SO Beautiful
I couldn't stand it
We went    to a movie and I found myself afraid of burglars for the first time in my    life
I wondered if it would be safe from flies, ants, spiders, anything
It was my baby
Btw, "The Illusionist" is a really good movie
The filming makes you feel    like it all actually happens, like you're right there watching the story    unfold, rather than just a distant spectator watching for idle amusement
And the magic
It's enough to make you believe it's real
The incredible    sleight of hand tricks- you don't know whether they're just movie magic or    an amazing talent performing real tricks
I know already that some things    they do are possible, but even when you see those ones in person you're    shocked
When they present the impossible, you believe that could happen too
It's    one of those movies where you come crashing down to earth when the credits    roll
You were sucked into this fantastic dream
and now you have to    come back to reality
It was one of those moments when you suddenly    realize you were on the edge of your seat, holding your breath and    gripping the armrests the whole time
It was an intense movie
Like I    said, really good
Though that seems pretty random, it's pretty important
When I was out,    Marissa called
Missing that one phone call sort of ruined what was left    of my weekend
Life's such a hassle, you miss a second, and it takes an    hour to get back on track
The rest of my night was basically trying to    get in touch with Marissa, then arguing with her parents why there was an    urgent "need" for us to see each other (which is pretty hard when both her    parents went to college and could easily teach her physics)
And so
we    failed
We were dragged away from each other in this horribly slow,    confused process
but whatever
I'm the sort of person that takes the world    and puts it kinda sideways
I'm really good at it sometimes, but right now    I'm not doing my job so well
The thing about me and Marissa, is that it's basically this epic struggle    against everything
For what
Well, most good stories tend to end with    wealth, happiness, a hard earned resolution, and true love
I think I    could go for those
and who knows
maybe Marissa will be there at the    finish line with me
Let's go through Sunday one more time, and figure out    why things are so screwy
Here it is
I didn't make anything excessively    exaggerated, yet amazingly not boring (thanks a lot, Charles    fuc
ookie
Dickens
and Jane freaking Eyre
Here we go
That    Brownie sequence
did I mention that those were beautiful and I almost    cried
The whole day, that's what I thought about
Right as I finished, I    just felt this amazing swell of happiness
The one thing I learned from    Jane Eyre was this
you have a cup of happiness, and it can be full
It    can even spill over when you're REALLY happy
It's amazing
That's how I    felt
The wealth of joy I felt with those brownies: I just had to share    it
I was so proud of what I had made, I wanted to share it with the    world
That was the original plan anyway, but now it was an unstoppable    NEED
I felt like calling every person in the school and asking them if    they wanted to try it
I bothered everyone who was online about it
I made    DEATH threats if they didn't like it (well, not really, but I should've)
I thought of Sasha and Kelly and Marissa and Rosie and Jamie and Abby and    Camille and the other Jamie and Sarah and Sophie and Lisa and Laura and    Kristen and Everyone
It would be Amazing
My cup was not just spilling    over with happiness, but it was blasting the extra into the sky like Old    Faithful (that SOUNDS really dirty, but its not
OK
I had to share    this with everyone
And The Illusionist
You HAVE to see it
There's a scene where he's just    practicing as a kid, and your jaw just drops open
One second the world    listens to rules, the next you literally expect pigs to fly
Hell freezes    over and
I donno, Rosie stops hating me
That's what it's like
Now    imagine that, only with romance, ambitions, regrets, and an amazing    storyline
For like two hours
It's shocking the producers didn't all die    of heart attacks
It scares me that people on the sets didn't get wings    and halos for there sheer perfection
I mean
how am I going to get    anywhere if they didn't
And Marissa
Well, it's a constant epic
Things are always happening with    us
I've decided to take a bit more casual drift on our fate lines
Things    happen, and the best we can do is expect to get wet on the river of time
Ok that wasn't a very well introduced analogy, but I was imagining a 6    Flags water ride
and that somehow relates to me and Marissa
Or maybe    just me
I'm a pretty messed up guy sometimes, but not really
I have a    crazy good life
Well anyways, THAT was how Sunday REALLY went
It was exciting, it was    intense, and it was pretty great
Monday
was the day
My mom was nice enough to drive to so I didn't have    to carry all that junk on the bus
full of people groping for my sacred    brownies
I came to school, and I was on a cloud
I was so phsyched
I was    so pumped
I was so anxious
My favorite line on Sunday was "Oh man, I    can't wait
because I would be able    to unveil my awesome creation
Jessye happened to get to the door at the    same exact time as me
So she was the First person for me to bestow this    awesome gift
I was thinking of making lots of little heart shapes out of    them, using COOKIE CUTTERS
but that didn't work so well, and I had    just this one random heart
Jessye ate it up
Wait
I missed a part
is this one for me
I made it Just for you
IRONY ALERT
sorry, couldn't resist
And then
she ate it
I didn't have any plates or forks or knives at    the time, so it's a good thing I cookie cuttered that one brownie,    otherwise there would be a lot of awkward scooping and all sorts of mayhem    going on trying to get a brownie out
It looked good
I don't think she liked it very much
that's ok though
She liked it well enough anyway
I scampered off in search of the next    person
I just couldn't wait
Sasha and Rosie were nowhere to be found (not that I usually find them in    the morning
so I took it    easy, just giving to whoever came down my path first
Kristen Cuprisinski would be SO mad at me if she found out I've    slaughtered her name this badly
But
For one of those brownies, she    would forget anything ever happened
But I just realized I'm not there yet    in my story, so hold on tight
First TENJI
Ok Eric Tengi (yes I will be switching around the letters    in his name, thank you very much) is this awesome kid who is what I like    to think of myself as
Awesome
and the subject of a lot of random    abuse
Tenji's cooler tho
but he's not a writer is he
I can just write    in that he has 14 nipples
he can't do anything about that
can he
Well, for now, he just has three horns
That's good enough
Anyways, three horned Tenji wanted some brownies
But
he's neither    cute, nor female, which is the basis on who's getting brownies
Well, he's    kinda cute
but that's just because he's sorta like me, but with more    horns
Those horns are pretty nifty
Good for deer mating ceremonies
I    guess
I donno
Someone should ask him what they do
Well, anyways, I was so pumped up
and then
I saw JAMIE
There she was
just standing there completely unsuspecting
except    that I told her on Sunday
I couldn't wait
These were going to be    amazing, and she'd get one
I felt like running or skipping or something to get over there quicker    (which happens SO much in my life
but about 50% of the time I'm wearing    a backpack or something so I cant and 30% of the time I feel too foolish
The other 20% I get confused somewhere between a hop, a skip, a jump, a    jog and a run
It's a kind of
flounce)
Jamie turns to see me coming    and I get out the brownies
I take one look and I get teary all over    again
They're so beautiful
The marshmallows look amazing, sitting so    nice on the top of it all
The chocolate frosting makes this smooth    beautiful finish
Where there were a couple brownies missing, you could    look down and see the layers, and everything was perfect
I scooped up a    brownie for her, put it on a plate (I had just recently stolen a couple    dozen plates and some plasticware from the cafeteria
Everything was set
BUAHAHHHAHHAHAHAHA)
And there it sat
I described the three layers
and    my eyes glazed over recalling all the good times we had together
Cael looked at them with envy
the EXACT response I wanted
And so
Cael became the    only boy besides me to receive a brownie
Why can't people follow a good    role model
Jamie took a small bite, and told me it was pretty good
The rest of the day followed along in this sort of pattern
Some guys want    it
but generally didn't get it
Some girls want it (Kristen loved    them
but she agreed with me on the nuts
next time I shouldn't put in    any nuts
In band, I made an amazing entrance
First there was Abby
She was one of    the people I found on Sunday, and heard of the exploits of the brownie
As    I sat on our conductor's podium, I unveiled my creation
There was a    brilliant flash of light, and suddenly I was amidst a swarm of hungry
brownie wanters
And then Schwartzer came
I got shooed away
and my    mission was failed
All I wanted was to give Abby a brownie
After class, I looked over to Sasha
She went on with her life
She went    on with her life without even wanting a brownie
Lisa
pulled a disappearing act
Me and Lisa are lovers
Abby told her    about that
even though it was
me
and lisa who
made it
I don't know how to describe it
All I know is that it's me and Lisa
And    we're lovers
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT A BROWNIE
Hey that smilie is pretty    cool
By lunch, I was running low
And there was Marissa
I viciously defended    the largest of the pieces
People would constantly try to take it, and I    would pull the brownies away and say "Woahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
woah
This one
was    for Marissa
That's all there was to it
This was it
or at least half of it
Marissa got a huge whopping    brownie
Her first response was "How do I eat it
I looked down and realized something
I    was suddenly in trouble
I had already promised Kelly one (Sunday, the    only words she heard from me were "you'd better like them
I couldn't just leave them hanging
But then again
I already    promised Jamie one (in homeroom she felt sick and didn't want it then) and    Sarah
actually ENJOYS food
and
I looked down
looked around, and realized it
Three left
and 8    people
I had it
Kelly was now the proud owner of
a brownie
She wasn't too    happy about that, seeing as she was the VERY first person I promised    brownies to
The rest of my table took the rest (except Meghan Casey
who
didn't want one
not even one FOURTH
The boys were pretty    unhappy about this
but that's ok
Then again
the girls at my table    were pretty confused at my creation of 4 slices from the remaining two
Throws everything off
These two    are special
they're for special people
My lunch table often tries to drag stuff out of me
such as "who are    those two for
not go out with Marissa
I    mean she dumped you enough times
The Art of Convincing
4/27/09     I was wondering:     Are the most convincing arguments, by definition, the ones that are least    impressive
For example, if I were to convince you that "A" is true, and do so in an    extremely rigorous manner, and you were to say "so what"
Does that mean that I've succeeded in convincing you SO WELL, that you    whole perspective and sensibility has fundamentally changed, so that you    believe that A being true is something natural, logical, and OBVIOUS
What if, a few minutes ago, you didn't feel it to be true at all
And now    that I've convinced you, you're not impressed
You just feel like you've    wasted your time
Possibly
We should do some testing on this
Wow, this makes
what
your THIRD letter
Gee are you popular
Well, I think I've proven my writing abilities with the first two
AND    THEY SUCK
well I thought it was funny     ha, you must be popular or SOMETHING because Becca's whole table swarmed    around me the day you gave me the note, it was scary
OR
did you tell    them
Whatever
I've decided that the whole dating drama isn't very good
I mean, we    aren't even going out and massive swarms of people are right in my face
Or maybe it just seems that way because I actually care
Its like,    suddenly the whole world is there staring at me
And now, as always, I'm relying on heavy duty lying and random flirting to    get out of it
whaa
Hah, I started flirting with someone who's name I forgot
It was
not an    unusual experience
That actually happens a lot to me
In fact, mostly, I    make a point to flirt only with total strangers, guys, and people who I    know hate me
If you'll notice, this one is padded out with layers and layers of gook
For one thing, I'm not in a creative mood
and for another, it makes a    very interesting statement writing two pages typed just to say something    that I fully intend to forget ALL about by the time I decide to finally    get to it
Well, lets see
I don't like the whole creepy stalker/lover letter thing     Freaks me out     PLUS, it made me go like, 5 days without ANYTHING going through my head    but you
makes for an interesting experience
try it sometime     Actually, if YOU do that, It'll be called "selfish" whereas ME doing it is    called "love"     I personally disagree
You don't need to be in love to think about    something
How about psycho killers that spend all day thinking about    blood
Blood
Blood
Blood
Anyway, they're not in LOVE with blood, they're just psychos
Suddenly, I've had a LOT of random thoughts too
They just pop up from    no-where
Like I was listening to the Beatles, and suddenly *hahdmgmhmh*    comes to mind
I just censored myself, if you were wondering
But the point is, that    suddenly the world takes on new meaning
A friend of mine was saying how    love sucks because you can ever ONLY know half the story- and I was    TOTALLY sympathizing
It was slightly freakish, how suddenly I know what    people mean by all of it
Personally, I say its just that obnoxious note- I was constantly    thinking-its just some random joke
Maybe Becca, or someone asked you to    hand me a note, and you had no idea what was inside, but I recognized your    handwriting
Specifically the "y"s - I thought they were very unique
Then a random idea came to mind
That maybe I was supposed to give it to someone else
So I played over the VERY short- mostly confused conversation we held, and    there was an obvious gap
You handed me the paper
I was afraid of it
what am I supposed to do with this
read it and
care
nothing else I could remember
I THINK you said "yeah    pretty much" but I think that's WAY off, because by this time, the people    were running out of homerooms left and right, and I was just thinking    "what's in this
and I was sad that I was right
because I knew, "here    comes the drama"     and then later
I was all depressive and such- very tired for no    apparent reason
And that's all I could think about
If there was a single idle moment,    that's what I was thinking about
Just saying now, this all sounds all mushy and generally disgusting
but    it was true     Every second went into that note, and from it, came you
and from ALL of    it came the drama
horrible things- those bums, must have nothing better    to do but gossip about who likes who
Its nice not to be oblivious, yeah,    but then you get labeled as a "gossiper"     And then people come to you for info, and then you get in this whole big    gossiping chain
All in all, it's a mess- I don't really like it
SO back to the main subject- me (specifically me & you
which there    isn't
yet
possibly for some time
Maybe
I don't know, it's a    mess)     Point is, that my parents aren't very big on the whole "dating thing" and    having a girlfriend and such, so I learned to avoid the whole who likes    who from an early age
So now, whenever someone says "oh, so and so likes you" and "
thinks    your really cute" I just sigh
Its sad though, because I'd like to go out    with you, but im also one of those
non-assertive guys
I think it'd be great fun to have all that money
Sarcasm's great for making people hate you- so I've noticed
I have WAY too much of it here for my own good

Ernest Becker     When we understand that man is the only animal who must create meaning,    who must open a wedge into neutral nature, we already understand the    essence of love
Love is the problem of an animal who must find life,    create a dialogue with nature in order to experience his own being

No man or    woman really knows what perfect love is until they have been married a    quarter of a century
Bessie Stanley     He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often and loved much;    who has gained the respect of intelligent men and the love of little    children; who has filled his niche and accomplished his task; who has left    the world better than he found it, whether by an improved poppy, a perfect    poem, or a rescued soul; who has never lacked appreciation of earth's    beauty or failed to express it; who has always looked for the best in    others and given them the best he had; whose life was an inspiration;    whose memory a benediction     Albert Einstein     How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and    physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love
Pearl Bailey     What the world really needs is more love and less paperwork
Bible     Love is patient, love is kind
It does not envy, it does not boast, it is    not proud
It is not rude, it is not self-seeking
It is not easily    angered, it keeps no record of wrongs
Love does not delight in evil, but    rejoices with the truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes,    always perseveres
Love never fails

Take Flight
After winning a swim meet, it's become tradition to toss our coaches in,    no matter how easy the meet was
We don't win a lot
so they don't get    tossed very much
After Robbinsville (Co-ed on Thursday January 17, 2008), I was walking    along the side of the pool with my towel around me, getting back to the    deep end to get my stuff and go
All of a sudden, the crowd parts, and I see a fully clothed DeHave'    grinning and laughing in a crowd of swimmers
All of a sudden he's    launched toward me, and we both fall in
Clothes, towel, and all
A wet towel's pretty gross, so after wringing it out and tossing it on    Schuyler, I'm somewhat reluctant to put it back on
Recently, I haven't really wanted to swim so much
just dive in, and    maybe do a lap of fly
I was pretty tired this day, so my brain sort of gets everything mixed up    into a big jumble
FLY
Leaping as high and as far as I can, I spread my arms out and stretch my    towel across my back
I tilt my head back in rapturous flight
soaring over the pool beneath    me
After a second
I notice my towel coming off my back
I'm not flying at all
I'm falling
With my arms still spread wide, I smack into the water, the towel    providing a HUGE area and a massive slap as we crash down
Laughing, I swim back to the block and hop out
Everyone seems to have noticed
I guess it was pretty loud
I guess you saw
I though a huge chunk of the ceiling fell in the pool at first
What happened
I just wanted to see if I can fly
Well, I felt guilty again
It was very saddening that I remembered less than I thought I did, so I    went back
I'm adding more
Last night, I wrote
I felt immensely    guilty about not getting you any sort of memento of love recently, [even]    as you seem to be giving more and more
Ironically, while the guilt drove    me to writ e this, I feel very little guilt about not getting home right    away yesterday to try and arrange seeing you on our anniversary
A month is a long time though, and sometimes I feel like I just want to    skip the week or so before the 21st rolls around
I really like the whole    once a month thing
I think I'll try to keep doing it
Partially because half the time    I'm not exactly living in the present, and partly because there's way too    much packed into every moment to be expected to know all of it"     "For example, I could write to about midway on the next page on how much I    remember of Beauty and the Beast when the teapot starts singing
I was    trying to hold onto that moment as long as I could, trying to remember    every detail
For the past few days I had been partially reminiscing over    past experiences and partially looking forward to new ones, But mostly I    was enjoying lots of Disney songs
Finding all sorts just everywhere I    eagerly took them in
One such song was from the dance scene in Beauty and    the Beast
As Mrs
Teapot started to sing, I noted it was on the 3rd    repeating patter of music
I noticed the music changed on the 4th to last    line of the 1st verse, and I thought it was odd how they spaced the lines    so randomly
The scene wasn't entirely dancing as I had imagined it, but I    soon lost interest in the visuals
After the first verse ended, I lost    interest in that too
The rest sort of blurred together like the T
V
was    playing in the next room over instead of the next YARD over
I remember    thinking that I wanted to be closer to you even though we were already    side by side
But that was all I remembered perfectly accurately
Saying    anything further would put me in a position of possible perjury-lying
I    thought hard to remember exactly what happened, but in my mind the movie    viewing was a completely independent event from being with you
I couldn't recall the exact places where you turned to face me, grinning    at the discomfort you caused in my mind
It was the sort of look I used to    struggle to describe
You would turn to me in the hallway, half worried,    half expectant, like you couldn't decide whether a risky move were worth    the gamble, so were waiting for me to come halfway
In that single look,    which I only saw about 4 or five times, you packed enough emotion to make    me want to give you exactly what you looked like you wanted
That was back a few months, where hugging was an acceptable "currency" of    love
Several times in the movie, you gave me a similar look
It was one half    expectant, but much happier, and more hopeful than worried
Of course we    both knew what was going on
PREPARE FOR A RANDOM, BUT PHILISOPHICAL TANGENT     I was thinking of this a bit, and made a sort of breakthrough in my    thinking
There were many ways of explaining this
What most people on the    outside think of us is that "She's wearing the pants
That's not    how it is
So, my original idea was that you're way hornier
YES hornier I did say hornier
go look it up in a dictionary if you have    to
I can't believe I had to teach you what this meant one time
You    have no idea what that means, so I go look it up with the already open    dictionary
I read off the literal meaning- covered with spines or horns
Then I go to the next one which has a sexual connotation- the one that I    meant)     So anyway, I thought of this a bit, and it didn't make perfect sense, so    suddenly it came to me
You must be much more in love with me than I am    you
Of course, that's rather sketchy, either way you look at it, and my    life would be a lot easier if I just deleted the whole last few    paragraphs, but oh well
hahaha
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Do you remember that one time I sat up and looked at you
Well, you said    something a bit mean, (I forget what it was
I SUCK at this
WAIT
you said
From there
I concluded that if I wanted you, I was in the    perfect position to strangle you
I'm a dangerous man
Speaking of perfect positions
I thought about my life one time
If my    life ended right now, it wouldn't be so bad
Every one of my goals has    been reached
I've finally won a medal
I've beaten Jared, I've been    published
Somebody loves me
But
I can always do better
I can win    more medals, and keep writing
And that Somebody who loves me
well, I    guess they need me to love them back
Then again
Sophie's getting    pretty demanding, I think I should just dump her, and get back with you
LOL anyways
but the point of all this is that I was in the perfect    position
And suddenly
Oh well, (as the seconds    ticked by the monodigital time) I guess sometimes you have the perfect    moment and it just slips through your fingers
Any other guy    wouldn't have moved their hand away from your chest when you took their    hand and wrapped it around you
its WIERD) Any other guy
You're turning _____________ years old now _______________________
I hope you have your eye on someone just in case    you get magically transported back in time
Its time for birthday hugs
HUG
Also, seeing as your birthday is earlier than mine, you get to drive me    around everywhere when you get your license
I have to pad this out to a WHOLE page so it looks like I actually care
Notice the spiffy triple space action     I love it
Also take note
That I'm so lazy
That I'm turning one sentence
Into four separate lines
Sweet
Happy birthday Amanda
I Owe Sasha $5     Because it was not boy trouble that one time
She totally forgot that happened, but, maybe I'll just buy her lunch or    something
and never explain what's up
Baby Kita owes me a dance and hug
Zaijian     Goodbye in mandarin     Gotta remember:     What is the blood
Where are the schools
Who will go to prom
Why are your friends so hot
And my logic is much off
Why does Sasha    Always see the worst of me
For example, Yesterday morning, I popped out of the corner behind the    vending machines with Elise, after our failure to make out in secret
And    immediately saw Sasha
From that second on, I didn't even look at Elise
I just pushed her toward    the gym door, and told her to get lost because she's a "horrible person
and a tease
And before that, I ditched Elise for Barzillai, and then I dropped    EVERYTHING for Sarah
And what I think is the worst part, is that I can imagine myself saying to    either of them
Because I would reassure them that Elise is just this    thing, and that to be with either of those two would be perfection
There    is "no one I would consider better, so there would be no way that I would    ever consider dumping them, unless it was simply not working out between    us
Because it opens the    possibility for dumping them for an "upgrade" as if they were simply    objects
Not only that, but because there are two people I would say this    to
Still 3/18/09     Hmmm, but that's not where I wanted to start today
I dreamt last night
That I was somehow involved in a track meet
And    there I frequently tried to get closer to Sasha
Who was also very    popular, among all people
And afterward, I was taking the bus home, but it was like a Rock Star's    bus, with tables and very comfy seats
Maybe more like a train
I Don't    know
But, I chose a seat far in the back, and had some type of fast food
And    napped, and I'm not sure if I listened to an Ipod
And Sasha was getting very close to some boy
Who was a "track Jock" -in    my waking terms
Eventually, I overheard some of there conversation
Apparently Sasha is a "PLC", meaning `clean'
According to them, she would    rather drink soda than beer
And one more example that I forgot
And Sasha and one of her girl friends were saying "I don't get it, why is    that a bad thing
I WOULD rather drink soda than beer
It's just how you    are
The "next foreseeable future" part was in unison with her friend, and they    both laughed
Her friend turned into a mix of Liz Lee and Eva and Bianca, most notably    with a mind/Voice of Liz Lee
She started some trouble by saying "Hey    Jeff, Why does Sasha have so many boyfriends all of a sudden
What's up    with that
But for some reason his hand doesn't quite seem to be around her
Shouldn't you know better than I
I mean
I    didn't know anything until I saw this one's arm here
Some guy, presumably    with her friend was sitting on the inside of the opposite side, and the    guy was closest to me on the outside
The hand gave mine a caress, and I suddenly looked up at Sasha
There was    still hope
The friend was saying some stuff I didn't care about
The dream began to break down
Sasha Suddenly gave me a look of fear
HELP    ME she silently screamed in thought-speech, sending an image of her cry    for help, while outwardly remaining infatuated with the male
Sasha had two arms, both visible, and yet so did the male, and    additionally had Sasha's arm around him
I looked down to the table, then to the male's throat
The only possible    option was to grab the dining hall knife that lay there, and quickly slit    his alien throat
I briefly imagined the move set and got ready to move as    fast as possible
But what if I was wrong, and was simply imagining it
The image was brief    and shockingly real
I took a long, hard look at him
His face grinned across the table, but    suddenly he sent me an image of another face turning towards me and    screaming violently, with unreal horror
I shot up in my bed
Other things followed, however
The alien told me    that although I thought I had slit his throat, he was already behind me,    and it was all a trick
I had lost
I had failed
And it was true
The scene reset
I unmasked him twice, revealing a bloody, empty mess,    that was presumed to be mechanical
I did the same for Sasha, but only    required one unmasking
I decided to get out of bed
5/3/09     The reason I have not responded to your text, is because you got into    Cornell, but are turning it down to go to Rutgers
I don't think I can easily forgive you for this
And I don't think I    should help you in any way to come to Rutgers
But
it's not my place to    try to dissuade you either, I think
I will later, maybe, but for now let me remember this: I think it is the    saddest thing in the world when I think of someone like you coming here
And for what
Money
I would gladly work every day of my life to get you the money to go to    Cornell
I've only ever twice seen so much potential wasted
The first is my    brother, a genius who slid through life
Coming to Rutgers was a conscious    choice, for a reason that is entirely his own
He seems to think that this    place is perfect for him
Or at least, the best available idea
The next is Owen, who also came here for the money
But he loves it for    very personal reasons now
There is a noticeable lack of pressure from    anyone
Not only that, but this place is his ideal existence
Large enough    to get lost in
To hide in
To be alone in
To spend some time at every    place, seeing everything, and being nowhere
To explore
He seems to    thrive in the crowd: being nothing but a face with a brain
He's also learning how people work
Forced contact with numerous people    every day
He is truly learning life here
But you
You know people
You are one of the kindest souls I've ever    seen
Funny and gentle, and lovable by all
And you're nothing like my    brother
You work, even when you could easily get by without ever touching    a book
You learn things on your own, even while having an active social    life, and being dedicated to your studies
You CARE about yourself and    about the world around you
And so
I'm angry
I'm disappointed
I'm hurt
And worse: I'm scared
What happens if the Sasha I know disappears    forever
Why should the world be robbed of one of the most perfect people    I know
Rutgers is a place of relaxed academic expectations, and even looser moral    ones
What if it breaks you
Someone like you deserves the best
Cornell is one of the best schools in    the nation
Why are you coming to Rutgers, when you could be at Cornell
I wish you would just
leave here forever, and have a good life
Forget    Rutgers, and forget everything
Forget me
Be happy
From lj (nov 26 2007)     something i've kind of always wanted to do    (kind of is key)    theres a few of these too
not just one     1) cultivate and perfect a look that indicates that i've been attacked in    a personal way by an offhand comment, but in a way that you will never    understand
It's happened to me at least a few times, usually with a connotation that    they will remember for the rest of thier lives, but never openly show it    to me
I've probably done it before
but its so incredibly powerful, i'd want    to learn to do it over the most trivial things
It'd be really cool if    someone did a really lame joke on something insignificant
and i just    blew them away with this look
2) Develop a way of writing or recording thoughts that will work better    for me
Because the way I write now, i get a lot of splitoffs, sideways    images, random connotations, etc
off of my main thought
and i can    chose to elaborate on them
and come back to my original thought after    the moment has past (usually changing my entire mood, and i pretty much    never get back) or jot these things down in one or two quick words off to    the side
but lose a ton of detail and kind of just chug along
Neither    is perfect, but the second one is better
I just usually dont have enough    space in my margins
And it never works as well in typing (typing is too    linear)
Angry
Awesome
The two great A words
It was so much fun    yesterday
Also, another thing is that if I plan to do anything with my writings
such as NEXT year's lit
mag
Then I'll have to actually get some new    material
Things I write usually have a purpose of telling a good story to my    friends and family
Well, I guess I'll have to start right away
The rest of this will be referring to you but hopefully I'll keep my mind    focused enough to maintain a sort of third person view, or at least make    it kind of impersonal
I like the wind, feeling it blow across your face and chest as you run    around the track
Its calming and cools you down
It slows down everyone else so I have a chance to catch up
It's a wonderful thing, but like so many other things it has the potential    to be harmful
Its sad how everything can turn out so badly
I feel so tired and worn out when it hits me that things meant for good    turn bad
A lot of people criticize me for my "exuberance"     Some people try to tell me not be so loud and happy all the time
Its weird that last part
You might think its pretty stupid to tell someone not to be happy, but it    happens a lot
I see this kind of thing differently
I see it two points of view, which gets on my nerves
Its from the one annoyed by all that chatter and randomness, and from just    having fun
You know what
screw this     I have something I can think of now, so im saying it now     None of this
STRUCTURE crap     I hate it how my body is stupid to me     It does everything way late     It's a pain     Another thing I realized, is that without you and my brother, I have    absolutely no incentive to do anything in track     Lets start from the bottomup     Today during track
lets see what happened during today at track     To best tell this story, lets start right before my small flash of    insight
Life is    odd, sending what would seem to be good to go and slap the bajeezus out of    people
Its like that Trojan horse thingie
always a classic
Suddenly as he enters she looks up and they see each other
He was    planning on just waving and going to change, but she starts to approach    him
So
naturally he just walks right up over to her
The main subject of conversation passed between them is about the most    recent track practice: a tough workout for both boys and girls
She says, "I'm so much slower than her now
She was, like, really far    ahead"     He contradicts her, basically saying that both of them are mad crazy    animals
He thinks himself to be perfectly logical in this conclusion, as    the "speedier" of the two went running every day during the break, while    his girlfriend's only practice was walking long distances to go    sightseeing in South America
Still, both of them were hitting    extraordinarily fast times, and nearly matched each other every time- the    biggest distance between them was about 10 yards near the end of the    practice
Getting obviously offended by this, she brings up the amount of pain and    agony used to achieve this close proximity to the other
are you kidding me
Only much later did he realize what she    said, and what it could mean
Much later, he goes through the whole thing in his head, when he was    SUPPOSED to be doing homework
He wonders why this always happens
her    momentary proximity can send him distracted for hours and hours of what    could be productive time
He secretly hopes it never ends
It was then he realized the complement- seeing that it could have meant    that she was saying he was fast
His mood immediately brightened at this    thought, but soon turned sour
big
stupid showoffy
bum
He was never good at    earnestly insulting people, the meanest things he ever does being nothing    more than slightly over the top jesting
After a moment of this, he wonders at exactly why he thought that
During    the entire workout, he only thought of showing off once or twice as he    passed her
Then he saw his own mind's connection: Spring Break and Cross    Country
In cross country, he had a single goal- to beat his older brother
But in track, his brother switched into sprints and jumps, those being his    forte
So, as a sort of substitutes, his main competition was her
After    mocking her habit of daily runs all winter, he became immensely slow by    comparison
Still, he worked up to within 5 seconds of her best time (sad    for a girl vs
guy
but true)     Over Break, he did nothing at all but sit around and eat
When he showed up to the first practice (still during the break, but after    a 5 day hiatus) he was painfully, immensely slow
His legs broke down,    giving him the feeling of standing still
His leg form was lazy and it    looked as if he had just finished practice when he was doing his warmup    lamps
He even had a cramp from the meager 2 laps
The pain persisted and    this broken down runner slowed down behind who was previously the worst of    the team
In a race that would have been a one minute drop in time for    him
As he worked hard to get his body into a shape other than "gooey    blob" and preferably into "swift runner" he found a certain lack of    incentive
His significant other, usually an empowering sight was nowhere    to be found, and without his drive to stay with the speedy female he    simply staggered into last place time and time again
Taa Daa
Great story
I came so close to using real names a couple times
Time for a break
Mmmm did you know that pineapple orange juice is delicious AND nutritious
I did, and boy was it good
My dad asked a lot of questions when I was    down there though
So anyway, next item on the list
well
previous
if you want to get    all technical     My body
is slow     Not just in track, because we already passed that part, but emotionally
Yes
I am emotionally slow     Sounds funny, but try not to laugh out loud and draw undue attention to    yourself
Well, see, on Monday I was tired, as expected, and maybe the slightest bit    depressed
I was trying so hard to be quiet and not make people hate me    right away
It didn't work, and I PO'ed Mrs
Lucci
Lol, it's a good thing    that you're in first period because otherwise you would have hear the    shark story
or snake story
whichever they called it
You probably    heard it anyway, it was from that day we went inside for practice and I    gave you chocolate when we were running in the hallways
So anyway, emotionally slow
I'm so on task
I was all like
aww, Marissa's not here
but not as much as trying to    be quiet
So I go home that night, planning to call you, but Ben was here, and you    HAVE to play when Ben is over
And he would make fun of me if I called
so when Ben left at ten, I was
moping
when my mom found me and made    fun of me
She also accused me of spraying
F
nevermind, that's    supposed to be a secret
Hah I win
Anyways, then this thing happened that ties into other things (graph paper    note) so I can just completely skip over that part
It also has to do with    my beginning w/ writing
Right, so the NEXT day, I kind of got all depressed because you weren't    there
for some odd reason
that was TUESDAY, or today
yes
so    I'm at my locker
rather late, and I go up through the intersection, and    BAM, I see you going up to your homeroom or
something from near your    locker
And I sort of stop dead in my tracks, talk to myself, and then go    powerwalking to find you
You know the rest
with the whole meanie    entrance
but the thing you DON'T know is that secretly I call myself    names for doing dumb stuff like that
The
ummm "fantasy" sort of thing I had going on is that I have my    bowtie and shirt looking all shnazzy and just jump over and give you a BIG    HUG
But
its been a long time idea of mine that I should have the    ability to completely hide my feelings at will- seeing as they get me in    SO MUCH TROUBLE grrrrr
apparently, my body temporarily granted my wish    at the most inopportune moment
I gave you one of the most impersonal greetings ever seen on the face of    the planet     Sorry about that
My official lie is that I was saving the big hug for whenever you finish    this letter
Marissa
Did you get picked up at exactly 5:23 and as soon as you entered    your car took out a water bottle and drank from it
I swore I saw you     I never finished telling you the Christine chronicles, or even the GOLDMAN    chronicles

Jeffrey63090 [9:32 PM]:   like
about everything    Jeffrey63090 [9:32 PM]:   like

all hiding and it makes me feel sad    Jeffrey63090 [9:33 PM]:   or that i was doing "nothing" on a certain    day
i was obviously doing something, but it wasnt very important    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:33 PM]:   aww

you    should really just tell me what's wrong    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   its usually nothing specific    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   nothing
you can really put your finger on    Jeffrey63090 [9:34 PM]:   or point    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:34 PM]:   ooh

AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:43 PM]:   well anyway
Jeffrey63090 [9:43 PM]:   heyy    Jeffrey63090 [9:43 PM]:   did you see marissa's hickey"    Jeffrey63090 [9:43 PM]:
Jeffrey63090 [9:43 PM]:   or did you forget to look    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:43 PM]:   no
i was looking for her
but i didn't see    her all day    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:44 PM]:   were you really okay with it
Jeffrey63090 [9:44 PM]:   i was kind of really excited for her
and then    when i found out it wasnt a hickey    Jeffrey63090 [9:44 PM]:   i kind of felt sad    Jeffrey63090 [9:44 PM]:   and then i wanted to know who gave it to her
after i found out it wasnt a hickey    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:44 PM]:   wait
it wasn't a hickey
AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:44 PM]:   what
Jeffrey63090 [9:44 PM]:   which kind of made me feel like a jerk    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:45 PM]:   wait
what was it
Jeffrey63090 [9:45 PM]:   i think it was just like a random welt    Jeffrey63090 [9:45 PM]:   or maybe a pimple    Jeffrey63090 [9:45 PM]:   but on her neck    Jeffrey63090 [9:46 PM]:   hahha a "PIMP"le    Jeffrey63090 [9:46 PM]:   hahahah     Jeffrey63090 [9:46 PM]:   nevvvvvvvvermind    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:46 PM]:   lol
have you ever seen a hickey
because a    hickey and a welt are two very different things    Jeffrey63090 [9:46 PM]:   well, it was a lot more red and hickey-ish when    i first saw it and then she covered it until later    Jeffrey63090 [9:47 PM]:   and i got a better look
and it wasnt red    anymore    Jeffrey63090 [9:47 PM]:   well a little bit was red    Jeffrey63090 [9:47 PM]:   but just like a dot    Jeffrey63090 [9:47 PM]:   so
either it went away REALLY fast, or it    wasnt a hickey    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:47 PM]:   lol
ooh ok    Jeffrey63090 [9:50 PM]:   ouchhhhhhhhhh    Jeffrey63090 [9:50 PM]:   my body hurts    Jeffrey63090 [9:50 PM]:   haha and my rock hard abs :P    Jeffrey63090 [9:50 PM]:   and those strong powerful arms that you love so    much    Jeffrey63090 [9:50 PM]:   and after all that swimming and running    Jeffrey63090 [9:50 PM]:   my hindparts are incredible    Jeffrey63090 [9:51 PM]:
are you feeling uncofortable at all
Jeffrey63090 [9:51 PM]:   nevermind    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [9:52 PM]:   hahaha

you should write about that
AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:11 PM]:   except    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:12 PM]:   that you were attacked by bears    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:12 PM]:   3    Jeffrey63090 [10:12 PM]:   three

Jeffrey63090 [10:15 PM]:   hmmm    Jeffrey63090 [10:15 PM]:   once upon a time    Jeffrey63090 [10:15 PM]:   there was this girl    Jeffrey63090 [10:15 PM]:   and this boy    Jeffrey63090 [10:15 PM]:   and this boy was incredibly "socially awkward"    Jeffrey63090 [10:15 PM]:   and they were friends since his first year in    pennington    Jeffrey63090 [10:16 PM]:   and we met in SS clas    Jeffrey63090 [10:16 PM]:   and she would sit in front of me (not by    choice)    Jeffrey63090 [10:16 PM]:   and we had Mr
Krichling    Jeffrey63090 [10:16 PM]:   if you dont remember, or never had him    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:16 PM]:   lol
i love how you changed it from "they"    to "we"    Jeffrey63090 [10:17 PM]:   Mr
Krichling is one of those guys who is half    a sometimes grouch    Jeffrey63090 [10:17 PM]:   (i know
i was thinking about that too)    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:17 PM]:   lol
okay continue    Jeffrey63090 [10:17 PM]:   and half sometimes a really kind of sweet    guy
like what you would imagine Santa to be    Jeffrey63090 [10:17 PM]:   and he also has lots of heart problems    Jeffrey63090 [10:17 PM]:   and it would be sad if he died    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:18 PM]:   mm hmm    Jeffrey63090 [10:18 PM]:   and anyways    Jeffrey63090 [10:18 PM]:   sorry, i had to write a little note to myself    about something i just rememberd    Jeffrey63090 [10:19 PM]:   anyway, so me and megan sat all in a row right    in front of him
and when he lectured we would look at his fangs    Jeffrey63090 [10:19 PM]:   because he was a vampire
ish    Jeffrey63090 [10:19 PM]:   see
he had all his normal teeeth    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:19 PM]:   megan who
Jeffrey63090 [10:19 PM]:   and then
right behind those     Jeffrey63090 [10:19 PM]:   he had fangs    Jeffrey63090 [10:19 PM]:   (Casey)    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:19 PM]:   okay
AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:19 PM]:   is she a new crush of yours
Jeffrey63090 [10:20 PM]:   and
megan had LONG LONG hair     Jeffrey63090 [10:20 PM]:   no, this is just a good story    Jeffrey63090 [10:20 PM]:   about chivalry    Jeffrey63090 [10:20 PM]:   its good    Jeffrey63090 [10:20 PM]:   anyways megans LONG LONG hair would ALWAYS be    on my desk    Jeffrey63090 [10:20 PM]:   and it botherd me    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:20 PM]:   mm hmm    Jeffrey63090 [10:21 PM]:   because if a girl doesnt have nice-ish hair
then i probably won't like her very much
because hair is one of the    best things about girls    Jeffrey63090 [10:21 PM]:   i mean
it smells nice    Jeffrey63090 [10:21 PM]:   and its sometimes really soft    Jeffrey63090 [10:21 PM]:   and it goes SWOOSH    Jeffrey63090 [10:21 PM]:   and sometimes it falls down on your shirt when    you give them a hug    Jeffrey63090 [10:22 PM]:   and if the girl really knows her stuff
she    does that thing where she gets everyone in the room to sort of stop    mid-sentance and look at her
all with hair    Jeffrey63090 [10:22 PM]:   it was really good on "sisterhood of the    traveling pants" movie    Jeffrey63090 [10:22 PM]:   just
so you know    Jeffrey63090 [10:22 PM]:   sarah was telling me thats how she passed half    her classes last year    Jeffrey63090 [10:22 PM]:   anywasy    Jeffrey63090 [10:22 PM]:   so
her hiar was all over my desk    Jeffrey63090 [10:23 PM]:   but instead of being like "yay hair, i love    hair, hair hair, hair hair"    Jeffrey63090 [10:23 PM]:   i was like
would you mind
Jeffrey63090 [10:23 PM]:   its probably because this was before marissa    made me notice how amazing girls can be    Jeffrey63090 [10:24 PM]:   (btw, you have amazing facial expressions and a    really nice laugh)    Jeffrey63090 [10:24 PM]:   welllll anyways    Jeffrey63090 [10:24 PM]:   (horray for awkward confession of the day)    Jeffrey63090 [10:24 PM]:   anyways (hmmm are you there anymore
then one day i decided i had enough    Jeffrey63090 [10:25 PM]:   hair would no longer find its way ALL OVER my    desk    Jeffrey63090 [10:25 PM]:   you know how girl hair sort of just arbitrarily    drops everywhere
and she still has a full head of it
Jeffrey63090 [10:25 PM]:   well, my desk one day was kind of covered with    hair droppings    Jeffrey63090 [10:25 PM]:   and i decided that instead of paying attention    Jeffrey63090 [10:26 PM]:   i would try to tie the ALMOST invisible strands    into a loop    Jeffrey63090 [10:26 PM]:   it was pretty hard
and it took me like 10    minutes    Jeffrey63090 [10:26 PM]:   but it was WAY more fun than listening    Jeffrey63090 [10:26 PM]:   and then
suddenly i had a loop of hair
Jeffrey63090 [10:26 PM]:   and had no idea of what to do with it
Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   so i sort of stretched it back and forth    Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   and then up and down    Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   and then it ALMOST broke, but didnt    Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   and so i streteched it a LITTLE more    Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   and it still didnt break    Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   and i stretched it a litttttttttttttttttttle    more    Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   and it still didnt break
Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   so i said "hmmmm"    Jeffrey63090 [10:27 PM]:   and then someone happened to be noticing    Jeffrey63090 [10:28 PM]:   and said "what are you doing
thats gross    Jeffrey63090 [10:28 PM]:   "yeah jeff, thats kind of creepy
but she kept it off my desk most of the time    Jeffrey63090 [10:29 PM]:   so that was nice    Jeffrey63090 [10:29 PM]:   well anyways, now we have lunch together and    she's going out with drew
who's a swim captain    Jeffrey63090 [10:29 PM]:   and i talk to drew    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:29 PM]:   mm hmm    Jeffrey63090 [10:30 PM]:   and
AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:30 PM]:   where is this going
lol    Jeffrey63090 [10:30 PM]:   this one time
drew was driving me home
and suddenly stopped    Jeffrey63090 [10:30 PM]:   right in the middle of my street
about 2    houses away from mine    Jeffrey63090 [10:30 PM]:   he just stops the car    AbbsOfSteel 1217 [10:30 PM]:   lol

Tales to Richard: Tuesday 9/23/08 King Neptune Night     Asian Vampires at Rutgers Ride Blue Bikes
In other news, I saw a REAL vampire today
He was asian and rides a    motorcycle
Blue
How do i know he's a vampire
because he's alergic to sunlight
I saw him by the College avenue gym
He was walking towards me, in the    shade of the building, helmet in hand
When the shade of the building stopped, he brought his helmet up, and    shielded himself from the sun
The rest of his body was covered by clothes    (longsleeved, leather biker jacket, pants, shoes
i don't remember his    hands clearly, but he probably had gloves on)
When he got into the shade of a tree, he put the helmet down
When he got out of the tree shade, he put the helmet up again
I even stopped to make sure he did it a third time at the next tree (i was    headed around the corner
I have a SCARYYYY story
Once upon a time, a young Jeff was thirsty
So, was going to walk over and    get dinner takeout: his parents love him, so they gave him a practically    infinite number of meal swipes, and can afford to just walk over for the    sole purpose of filling a nalgene with iced tea
So
the Delucca Child decided he was far too lazy to put on shoes, and    simply grabbed as many bottles as he could find, shoved them into a bag,    and went down in flipflops
Jeff never wears flipflops
When he does, he trips on himself and walks    funny to lower the amount of times he screws up
He takes long, slow    strides, even longer and slower than his normally longish, slowish    strides
For a short guy, he walks funny
the situation seems strange,    at least in his own mind
Looking at his shadow, it almost looks as if his    upper body is sliding along slowly as two long, writhing tentacles propel    him along
It's a cold night, but he sees many people about
On his way, he looks up at one of the buildings
Riya's room is in that    building
and he hasn't seen her or her roommate for a while
It would    be strange if they were easily in sight from the ground
But interesting,    he thought
As his shadow slides along, a strange commotion begins behind him
a    couple of girls scream, giggle, and shout as they flutter about
Flipflops    clacking against the ground, they run closer and closer, shouting to each    other the whole way
Jeff ignores them, and slides along slowly
The first girl runs past, and turns back
At first, her face was just a blob
Slowly cheeks come into focus, then    forehead and nose
They eyes appear, but remain a blur
Mouth next, and the smiling face is suddenly familiar
The voice plays    over in his mind and he recognizes it as Riya's
He waves back slowly
Her face is completely unfamiliar that night
But he recognizes her name,    and knows it to be her
The run into Tillett
He follows a minute slower, watching as they charge    forward, regroup, look about, and proceed to the next checkpoint
Like worms
he thinks, meaning nothing but the movements are jerky
turn-based almost
He heads to the takeout door, after holding the door open for three others    after him
They talk about wireless
He looks at the closed door
The door that tells him that takeout doesn't happen on King Neptune Night
He tries the door anyway
It doesnt open
He gives it the finger
He tries the normal cafeteria door
Firmly shut
if i get in, won't the drink machines all be off anyway
It is meant to open towards him, and doesnt have    handles
Suddenly, his memory takes him back to Hopewell Valley
In his mind, he's    3 minutes late for class, and walking up the 300 hall
A Social Studies    teacher strides powerfully toward the "emergency exit" doors of the    Library
Jeff smiles confusedly, quietly thinking "you can't get in that way
Friction
Press Hard Against the window frame, and pull
Open towards you
He walks toward the door and peers inside
Empty
Dark
Quiet
Empty
He tries the left
It's heavy
The right
It jumps, but he loses grip
The surface is too small
Larger
The top
He puts his hand over the left door
The gap is large enough for his    fingers, but the door is closed
The right
There's a grove cut for this specific purpose
It swings open easily
He takes a step inside and freezes
He looks down at the light at his feet
As the door swings shut, it grows    smaller and smaller, then changes color as the primary light source    changes to the dirty window
CLANG
as the door shuts
He jumps, and thinks about batman
Vampires are probably here
He ascends the turning stairs slowly
There's nothing but his own clacking flipflops
He enters the main dining hall after looking through the window
Empty
Lights scattered throughout the floor are still on
One shortly before the    drinks, one above the center table, and very dim ones scattered about
No sounds
As he approaches the drinks he thinks "you shouldn't be here
As he fills up the larger bottle with Iced tea, he hears sounds from the    back rooms
Small clangs, but nobody interest in his prescence
He begins to head out
The sitting area closest to the foodlines is often closed
Similar to the    other eating area, one light over a central table is always on
When the    day is dark, the room is very ominous
Very creepy
The first time he saw it, he had a momentary flash of someone sitting at    the table
Eyes fixed straight ahead, hands folded in front of his mouth
Watching everything
Silent
Alone in the dark
Seeing all
Waiting
Jeff stops
Looks at the beam of light coming down on the table
It looks    almost too empty
He head back to the drink fountains
A second bottle
with
Gatorade
Orange
The voice says clearly "you had your chance to leave
A thud is heard from behind him
He doesnt look
All he does is stuff his lanyard string into his pocket,    so if he gets caught he can try to claim he's someone else, and not have    his ID checked
He feels a presence to his back left
He ignores it, and watches the waterlevel rise in his bottle
He feels cold breath on his right neck
His bottle fills up too much, and he casually drinks from it
Watery
He turns and walks out
Vampires
This bottle leaks, don't put it in your bag
This bottle is heavy, don't    put it in your bag
So he carries the bottles in one hand, and the empty bag on his right
He walks slowly, his shadow sliding slowly along
The vampires aren't hungry tonight
And not thirsty now

Amanda     I do a lot of weird things sometimes     There was this one time, when I got involved in a punching contest with    you
It really hurt
so I kept punching you
and then you got really hurt,    so you punched me back
It really hurt
so I kept punching you
and then you got really hurt,    so you punched me back
It really hurt
so I kept punching you
and then you got really hurt,    so you punched me back
Haha, that's a classic     But seriously, I do a lot of weird things sometimes     And usually, my sense of guilt kicks in and I try to make it up
There was this one time
when it happened twice in a row
During Social Studies,
Or actually
Here I'll start over
One day, it was a Tuesday
The day was nearly like any other
but that    doesn't matter
What matters is where the minute changes were
At a local    school, there were two people
One of them was a young boy with a lot of    weird things going on in his life, and in his mind
They weren't    specifically malicious, but they did tend to make like a bit harder, or a    bit more uncomfortable than necessary
In his opinion, they made things a    lot worse, but a lot more interesting
So that was the general thought    that the people around him adopted
People who were his close friends could count on his    goofy style to cheer them up when everything else was going a bit    sideways
At least around him, sideways seemed a bit more natural, and so    they stayed with him
The other person was a young girl
This is the story of her, and her    unusual plight
She was in an unusual position
The next day, a Wednesday,    was the day that she would be allowed to dissect a crayfish
Unfortunately    she needed to go on a trip due to her involvement in a class which she was    dedicated to
She strongly relied on the young boy in this story, for she    was in need of sustenance but must go to her French class during what was    her normally scheduled lunch period
Why
Because instead of doing the    dissection on Wednesday, she was forced to carry it out on Tuesday and so    skip the ordinary French class
At the Biology Class, she told her deep    need to Jeffrey and he accepted the call to duty, Promising to bring her a    much needed snack later in the day
In a stunning move of stupidity, He forgot
Now, what does this have to do with you
Not only will this serve to amuse you (hopefully), but it does show you    quite well that sometimes I do weird things     For example, using an apology to tell a good story to a close friend
At the end of Social Studies, I got the "young lassie" (I just felt like    using that phrase) a bagel and some Cheez-its
And so, as a form of apology, I will bring you a bagel and some    Cheez-its
If I remember
