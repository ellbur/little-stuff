EKA: You're a Quaker you're not supposed to swear
KMFE: All right, clever, but I'll tell you the whole story
So Jeff met Elise (not for the first time) at the High School
Elise was trying to plan a presentation for English
Jeff: What does it have to be about
Elise: Pretty much anything
It just has to somehow relate to Catcher in the Rye
Jeff: Can it be about classy ways to use the phrase "fuck you"
Earlier Elise's dad had made an unhelpful suggestion
Dad: It should be about the meaning of life
Elise: What, you want me to stand up there and talk about the meaning of life
Dad: Wouldn't that be cool
Elise: That's such an old topic
Dad: Maybe it's old because it's good
Jeff thought that didn't make any sense
Jeff: You can't control how old something is
That doesn't say anything about it
Elise: I think he meant it keeps coming up because it's interesting
When Jeff went home Elise went to see Lexi and Jeff talked to KMFE online
KMFE: So are you and Elise really together now
Jeff: Yes, we are officially together
I am officially happy about that
KMFE: Oh, officially
How do you really feel about it
Jeff: No I'm really happy
For real
Lexi thought Elise was a terrible person
She didn't really think that
Maybe she did
Lexi: I can't believe you're using him like that
Elise: He was using me before
It'll even out
Lexi: It's not gonna turn out good, you know it
Lexi was worried that Elise was using Jeff to get with Sasha
She really didn't want to get involved, but she thought maybe she'd give Jeff a hint
She went to talk to Jeff on Facebook
How vague a hint can you give and have it still be worth anything
Coincidentally, KMFE was right now complaining to Jeff about how he doesn't like hinting
KMFE: Either you tell them, or you don't
Either they understand the hint, or they don't
I don't see what you gain from giving them something they maybe understand
PL thought that was just what was so perfect about giving a hint
It devolved you of responsibility
Perhaps KMFE was indirectly complaining about PL
It turned out Jeff had more to tell Lexi than she had to tell him
Jeff: Something bad happened
Lexi: Oh man, I should have told you earlier
Jeff: YOU KNEW
Lexi:
Lexi: yeah
Jeff: No, you don't know
You're thinking about something else
Lexi: Is this about Elise
Jeff filed that under "ask about later" (which he wouldn't do normally, but for once there was something legit interesting to talk about)
Jeff: OK, so I found a way to separate my sane half from my insane half
Lexi: I didn't know you had a sane half
Lexi: haha just kidding Lexi: And what, the insane half turned into Mr
Hyde and knocked down a poor girl in the street
Jeff: More like the sane half did that
He got away
But think about this
Imagine a person who looks and sounds just like me, right, exactly like me so you can't tell the difference, but is perfectly normal
Is that not the most awful thing you can think about
There was a knock on Sasha's door
She got up from her essay, paused thirty seconds to adjust her eyes away from the screen, paused some more to not fall over from dizziness, and went to answer it
The sane Jeff was there
They talked for a while about Jeff's trip to Shanghai and Singapore, but then Sasha had to get back to her essay
Before he left, the sane Jeff asked her out to dinner for this Friday
She said yes
Jeff had to find the terrible impostor, but first he REALLY had to convince Lexi he was telling the truth
Lexi: Jeff, you're not making sense anymore
I don't understand why you're talking about splitting yourself into two people
Jeff: Obviously because it HAPPENED
Jeeze
By the time he got up to hunt for his alter ego, the alter ego himself stepped into the room
But Sasha was clever enough to know something wasn't right
3 AM that night she passed out on the keyboard
4 AM she woke up and realized what had happened to Jeff
She went and got her bike
When she got to Jeff's house she called and he let her in
Sasha: Where is he
Jeff: In bed sleeping
Sasha: We need to decide what to do
Jeff: I know
We can't kill him, and I don't see how we can get rid of him
Sasha: How did you create him
Jeff: I don't want to talk about it
Sasha: Can I see him
They went up to Jeff's room
Sasha: Aww he looks just like you
There wasn't anything else to do here so Sasha went home
Sometime later it was Friday
Elise gave her presentation in English
She talked about her annoying father telling her to write about the meaning of life
She made it sound profusely reflective and deep, and intimately connect to Holden Caulfield
Sasha waited patiently for Jeff's creation to show up, then stabbed him with a knife, cut up the body, and buried it
Years later a Norway Maple grew from that patch of ground
Decades after that a little boy named Will liked to climb in that tree
Sasha's daughter Lydia babysat Will occasionally and watched him climb
He jumped down four flights of stairs and started to run
He would run to Livingston and back and then do mechanics homework
It's cold out and there is ice on the ground
You could see stars if the street lights weren't so bright
Man it sure is annoying to listen to someone laughing
Happiness can be so gross
EKA walked past all the doorknobs on the way out and AR's door was closed
He would pretend to be a soldier in some other country far away from AR and trying not to miss her
It's good to have a story when running
Yes he's delivering a message; that's why he's running
To Livingston – he has to get there fast
Better run faster
Cold, ice, no socks, makes the fight more real
Running over the bridge now and about to cross Avenue E
What is it with laughter that drives EKA out of the building like this to run
Take a shower and wash the laughter off
Man it's cold out and a shower would be warm
On AR's door it said “The first Noel
Won't be able to deliver the message in time
Learn to appreciate laughter
EKA failed to deliver the message and failed to talk to AR
Now that's good he can be something consistent: a failure
It's a lot nicer than trying to be everything
Man and he almost could be everything he was like so close but that's just so confusing and it's good to be something consistent
Learn to love laughter
He got up from his computer and navigated through a maze of cables
It was Andrew and TDCP
TDCP: Can we come in
KMFE: Sure
Watch the cables
He led them over to where he had been working
They all sat down
TDCP: So, pretty
interesting place
KMFE: It fits my life
I'm programming pretty much 24/7 now
TDCP: Yes, we know that
KMFE: You're here to ask me a favor
Andrew: How'd you guess
KMFE: Old story
The patriarchal hero retires into a quiet life, the young people keep fighting
Then some powerful monster shows up and they come drag the old guy back into the mess
It's a classic plotline
TDCP: Beautifully perceptive, except as we are the same age I would not call you the patriarch
KMFE: Well since you're the one about to propose something crazy (I'm guessing) that makes me the wise one
So what arcane technology do you want me to beat up this time
TDCP: Actually, we weren't after your hacking skills
KMFE: All right now that is the second bad sign
The first is that you want to drag me out of my peaceful life
You know I have a job, work full time, and have given up on crazy schemes
TDCP: And give most of your money away because you don't know what to do with it
Andrew: In other words we think you're bored
Unless there's something we don't know about Democratic Republic of Congo
KMFE: Lowest per capita GDP
I don't trust silly schemes like shipping mosquito nets over to Africa
Poor people need money, plain and simple
TDCP: And the second bad sign
KMFE: You're not after my hacking skills
You see I understand hacking
If I'm working with computers I know what process I go through to get stuff done and I trust it
Of course it's not the only thing I can do, but I don't understand anything else
Even just talking to you people here is a mystery
KMFE opened the bottom drawer of his filing cabinet
He searched around for a folder and took it out
KMFE: But the other way this is like the classic story, is that I've seen worse than you
You guys have some ambitious and idealistic goals, I'm sure, but you haven't seen what that kind of thing can do
But I have
And if you want to know part of what pushed me into a normal life, is that I've seen unreal things
Things that are simply impossible
This world is messed up in a metaphysical way that you haven't even dreamed of
He opened the folder and showed them a picture of a woman standing at a train station
KMFE: And it didn't help that she died
She was the most amazing person I ever knew
She tormented me the whole time I knew her and I never resented her for it
At least never for long
TDCP: KMFE, you barely knew her
KMFE: Oh so you recognize her
TDCP: Of course I do
That's :P
She knocked down the church while we were in it
KMFE: Oh that's right
OK, well, then you have some idea
Andrew: Believe me, we do
KMFE looked nervously at Andrew sensing a hint that the favor they were about to ask involved :P
But she's dead now
TDCP: KMFE, we want you to travel back in time
KMFE paused for a few seconds, keeping eye contact so they wouldn't jump in and say something before he did
KMFE: I think it hardly needs saying that that is a fourth very bad sign
But this better not be one of those things
TDCP: No, it's not
KMFE: You're not asking me to kill Hitler, right
Because you know that's been tried before
TDCP: Time travel has been done before
KMFE: I said 'tried', not 'done'
I'm not meddling with history for you
But I assume you know better
So what is it
TDCP: The thing is, KMFE, we can't tell you
We just want you to do this
Andrew: We think you can ask :P to call you back in time
You met her a long time ago
KMFE: And you believe this because
Andrew and TDCP looked at each other briefly
TDCP: We don't want to tell you that, either, KMFE
But we're pretty sure this will work
KMFE: Well, you haven't told me what my incentive is
I mean, you could argue that you're old friends, but I think this is a bigger deal than that
TDCP: I assume money won't work
KMFE: Of course not
Look, I'll make this easy, because it's pretty obvious what I really want
TDCP: OK
KMFΕ: I'll do this messed up plan of yours if you tell me why
Andrew: Look, KMFE, I'll give you an incentive
No one has ever gone back in time before
If you don't do this, no one ever will
KMFE: Andrew, you play mean
But come on guys, what is it
I met :P in September 2001; this better not have anything to do with that
Andrew: No, nothing to do with that
KMFE: And this better not be some silly hunt for meaning and purpose and the reason for existence because I'm sick of things like that
TDCP and Andrew looked uncomfortable
KMFE: This is, isn't it
Look, there is no meaning
There is no purpose
Not forward or backward in time
And what really gets me, is the notion that just because something's never been done before, like time travel, that it will provide meaning
People do things that have never been done before all the time
It never tells you anything new
TDCP: You sound pretty indignant for a nihilist
KMFE: Hah are you kidding
Nihilists can be the most indignant people you'll ever meet
But I'm not a nihilist because I never thought meaning mattered in the first place
Andrew: From your perspective then, your task is to gather more evidence that the universe has no purpose
KMFE: There's overwhelming evidence already
Andrew: Not from time travel
KMFE: What, so you want to turn the human race into some sort of grand proof of meaninglessness
Then when World War III comes around you can write it all up and say "look here, everything humanly possible has been accomplished and none of it meant anything"
Andrew: If that's how you want to see it
Andrew was visibly upset about this
KMFE sat there looking reproachful until TDCP tried to explain
TDCP: KMFE, Andrew's coming at this from a different angle
He keeps existing, forever, from one universe to the next, past creation and destruction time and time again
So you just go through your one life seeing no point to anything and you're OK with that
But Andrew's seen more universes than you can count, and every single one has been just as empty
Imagine how discouraging that must be
Now this girl :P comes along who can predict the future, read minds, knock down bridges by looking at them, and he thinks "I haven't seen that before"
And he thinks that maybe this is the only chance he'll ever get to find a meaning to existence
KMFE: I further object to the idea that just because something seems to go against reality that it might have some mystery hidden in it
Just because something goes against the laws up physics doesn't mean it's special
TDCP: You may be right about that, but you could still do this as a favor to Andrew Andrew: KMFE, we've told you why, now
KMFE: That's right
You did
Well, I guess here goes
It's easy to think you can, because the ideas that you are least willing to question are so familiar to you that you don't notice them
Perhaps a horribly abused person who can no longer trust being near another human being could claim to have no unquestionable faith
Maybe
But there really is more to faith than just accepting ideas without questioning them
There is also an inescapable element of humility
You cannot be proud of believing that the Earth was created in 6 days, or that Jesus could make a man see by spitting on his eyes
But you can believe it
And you don't even have to be stubborn about it
It requires humility
Everyone could be humbled just by looking at the world around them
But it's too familiar, too expected
I used to think of the miracles in the gospels as simply a communication device used to represent Jesus's unique relationship with God
But now I think they serve another role
They ask the reader to believe or consider things that are unnatural and absurd, to brake their mind out of things too common to notice so they can actually see what's there
They sat there wet and cold without talking for awhile
KMFE: You haven't disappeared yet
KMFE: That's very nice of you
I wouldn't have showed up otherwise
I'd much rather be back home right now
KMFE: Oh come on, you don't like being a fugitive in a freezing cold river
KMFE: I thought I was picking a place where people wouldn't find me
Jo: You're new at this kind of thing, though, aren't you
I mean you left plenty of clues
KMFE: Yeah, I am
I always expected to get caught sooner or later
I did not expect to be rescued by :P
A few minutes passed in silence
KMFE: :P, you intimidated everyone in some way
KMFE: Yes, you know that
There were people who were amazed that you could do everything, it seemed like
And there were people who were always jealous of you
KMFE: I don't know
I wasn't jealous of you
I remember one time, at a robotics competition, when you followed me around like everywhere
KMFE: Well
yeah
I mean, not everywhere
KMFE: Well, ok, I was amazed by you
But you used to seem real
Now you seem like some fantastic specter
That's why I'm surprised you don't disappear
Jo: Hey if I can take a crack at psychoanalyzing, I think the problem is you have too many old memories of :P
I mean, she was around you permanently for a very long time
It's like she's a feature of the environment
Now it's not like that and something seems wrong
When it started to get dark :P and Jo left
She warned KMFE that he needed to keep heading downriver or he might get caught
So KMFE slept that night on the bank
but for some evil reason it is (It's not really important what 'it' is here
It could be anything
It's hard to say exactly why
Just that it can't be that she really doesn't want it to be an issue
Otherwise she could just not care
Even if she says it's "like 100% my parents", parents' opinions matter
Jeff: age-ism is cool too
It's not really age that's important, though
It's experience and maturity
Allow me to explain my theory of levels: You should be careful about dating anyone who hasn't crossed the same life-epochs you have, such as graduating high school, graduating college, etc
Now there's an obvious problem with this that two people of at least one year difference school-wise will always periodically be on different sides of these epochs
Well, it's true, and it does cause problems
In some ways it's nice to see that Jeff can be just as clueless as anyone else
There's another way to interpret this exercise
First let me give the basic summary
Jeff gave me a lot of his files
Among them were some transcripts of conversations with Elise
So I made it my mission to learn and imitate Elise's writing style, for the purpose of messing with Jeff's mind
Right now I am stepping through a conversation line by line, trying to fill in Elise's half
Jeff: so, last night i was hanging out with one of my closest friends who i basically tell everything to and he asked me a funny question "is it ok for me to tell people that you're with Elise
I mean, we're actually together now, so i'm not just using her or anything
I'm happy about this
So yes, you should tell people, if you want
I also remember it a little differently
I think you just said basically "yes" and "I'm officially happy about that"
Which was the motivation for this part of the story: Jeff: Yes, we are officially together
I am officially happy about that
KMFE: Oh, officially
How do you really feel about it
And what I was surprised about was that you didn't sound awkward about it at all
So I thought like, wow, maybe this is actually working out, if he cares enough not to go all defensive
Elise does not seem to have the same "recursive digression
The old man lived alone, never leaving the house
He was almost deaf and blind, and near death
He knew he wouldn't live much longer but he never mentioned death
His nephew came over every day from noon till two to take care of him
The nephew used to pester the old man about his seclusion but eventually decided to let the man have the peace he seemed to enjoy in his last years alive
But the old man never answered and stayed in solitude
His name was Mathew but everyone called him KMFE
It was the name he used for himself
But he never talked much, and never spoke to anyone unless they spoke first
Mostly people didn't talk to him either
He wasn't unhappy, although he often expressed his joy in life through sarcasm, and the message was unclear
For a time he seemed to enjoy mentioning The Telltale Heart to the nephew and stretching out what it meant for his own fate, but bored of this eventually
He lived in front of a long and busy road
He said he never watched the cars because it depressed him, but he said it in a way to suggest he was not in the least depressed over anything
The nephew never asked if he was bored with his life; there wouldn't be much left anyway
There was an event which finally broke the monotony
It began when a women of about his age, although in far better health, moved into the house next to his
The nephew noticed that the old man had become excited -- that was rare
The old man explained, "It's actually happened
I told him I would recognize her
Now I do; after a very long time; long enough to prove it, i think
It might have been the saddest loss to the old man but he did not rank sadness, or often show it
Twenty years ago he would have observed this trait in himself but now it was merely instinct
The man called the new neighbor Easter Egg
She had another name but he did not want to answer it
The name he gave her was not a metaphor; it had a meaning the old man did not explain
The nephew didn't press the old man for explanations anymore
Once the old man could speak openly about his own life, but at that time he chose not to, and now he could not for forgetfulness and incoherency
It could only be considered suprising that the old man remembered Easter Egg at all
But he did remember very well
Easter Egg did not specifically remember KMFE, but it did not matter to him
I'd be there with my laptop, and I'd say hi to you, and maybe you couldn't tell that I was always happy to see you
I'm outside of the suite right now, in the quiet study room on my floor, late at night, working on PEE Lab
But no one walks by
And if they did I wouldn't know them
She had been under the care of the group from Korose while she had been unconscious the past 15 hours
Now she was sitting underneath a small tent outside of Korose's vehicle
She sat there a few hours just watching
The Korose didn't bother her
AR got out from under the tent and sat against a sugar maple nearer the field
The Korose concealed most of the camp in the ribbon of trees between this open space and the next
It was a clear, warm sunny day
KMFE walked over and stood by AR
She didn't recognize him at first because he was wearing a Korose uniform
He took off his helmet and smiled at her
KMFE: Want the story
AR: You mean of how I got here
KMFE: Well, any story you want, really, but uh yeah, that's the one I thought you'd find relevant
AR: Sit down
KMFE sat against the same tree
The red white and blue colors of the Korose uniform had nothing to do with the US government
AR had formed an unpleasant association with the image, so she was avoiding saying much
On the other hand, this was not the worst possible explanation for where KMFE had been the past two weeks
The full story, which KMFE did not tell AR, went like this
KMFE had been standing in a crowd with several Korose, in front of a platform on which another Korose was giving a speech
The police had been giving the them a hard time, and were there listening to the speech, as were a large number of college students, and some other people from the area
No one found out that the person giving the speech was a Kereol in disguise until he took out a gun and started firing into the crowd
A fight started
When the police were somewhat keeping things under control, the Korose in charge asked KMFE to make a speech
He was the only human Korose there and they desperately needed  to prevent a PR disaster
He knew he couldn't get up on the same platform without provoking the police, but another Korose was dealing with the problem and soon an officer waved him to go up
The police were confused and were just as happy to keep the situation calm, even as they preserved their anger and hatred
KMFE took off his helmet to prove he was a human and walked up to the stage
KMFE wasn't sure what to say, since, although the individual who started the fight was not a Korose, he couldn't help but think that the Korose were not entirely guiltless
So he started to talk about the need to forgive, to resist the urge to retaliate, and to answer violence with peace
Before he could make much sense out of his words he saw AR lying face down on the ground
The image destroyed him
The Korose were angry that KMFE had screwed up the speech, and they weren't amicable to his requests that they help AR
The fight did end up being a PR disaster
But KMFE yelled at the Korose so much for being heartless (though this was a foreign term to many of them) that they gave in and took AR with them to the camp by the cornfield
KMFE didn't tell AR about the speech he made, or about how little the Korose cared whether she lived or died
He especially didn't tell how he had picked her up, and carried her to the Korose vehicle, while crying and screaming at the top of his lungs into the microphone for the translator
How he had deplored everything about the Korose organization and felt that he shouldn't even be here now
But he did tell her the reason that kept him
He brought over the radio and turned it on
The sounds were unintelligible, so he scrolled through the stations until clear English came out
These were the messages that some tiny planet orbiting some star out there in the milky way had decided to share with its neighbors
Even when the translator knows the language, the content is still completely mysterious, KMFE admitted to AR when she asked what the words meant
The Radio:
The first person was asked to explain away yourself
Pending further happiness, you will be sent between the reason and his explanation
I haven't trusted this before
KMFE: One time I turned it on and it was all about rocks, and then I noticed it was even more specific, because it was all about the pieces of a planet that had been shattered, and the speaker had tracked them all down to describe where they are now
He paused
KMFE: Once I even heard a planet die
I was listening to the radio and the sound just stopped, so I asked the Korose and they told me that planets are really very fragile things, and it's not even unlikely to hear one exterminated in an instant
KMFE: And of course, no one knows what happened to them, or ever will, and odds are no one was even listening to the broadcast when it happened
He looked at AR and then back at the sky
KMFE: So you see, I just can't leave this
I can't go back into the world where I have no contact with an entire galaxy, knowing what I know now
I'd feel completely trapped
KMFE: Can you elaborate on that
JL: For every thing that happens, there is a true statement that says that that happens
You take this set of true statements, and it describes everything
So everything is predetermined
KMFE: Ah, so, if, say, thing 'x' happens, you say there is a true statement that says that 'x' happens
JL: That's right
KMFE: And what is that statement
JL: 'x' happens, for whatever 'x' is
KMFE: That's not a statement
JL: Yes it is
How is that not a statement
KMFE: Because you didn't say what 'x' is
JL: 'x' could be anything
If 'x' were 'it rains today', the statement would be 'it rains today happens'
KMFE: Ah, but you see the key there is you had a way to describe what 'x' is
If you can't do that, you can't form a statement
Now give me a chance to explain something, because you happen to have wandered into one of my favorite philosophical traps
Now, I don't know much about the real world
So I'm going to start by talking about abstract things
I want to convince you that it's naive to assume that "x happens" must be a statement
Do you know about cardinal numbers
Or countable and uncountable sets
JL: Yes, I do
KMFE: All right, good
So let's talk about the real numbers
Because there are more real numbers than integers
Now we form statements out of symbols, and we have at most countably many symbols
So the set of statements is at most countable
That means that there is a real number about which there is no statement
It goes deeper than that, in fact
Our brains have at most countably many thoughts
So there is a real number that it is impossible to even think about, even given an infinite amount of time
JL: But you're assuming you have countably many symbols
KMFE: Well, it doesn't actually matter how many symbols you have
You take the power set of the set of symbols, and you've got something too big
So no matter what there are some "things" you can't form statements about
JL: So how does this apply to the real world
KMFE: Now, I don't know whether everything is really determined
And I don't know whether there really are countably many things in the real world
I suspect you don't either
So at the very least your argument is inconclusive
But I would like to show that while these true statements might, in some universes, determined every "thing" that happens, they wouldn't
really
Not the way we think of things
They wouldn't get every interpretation of every thing, which is what we really think about when we think about a thing
So, say thing 'x' happens, and we have (because we're lucky, mind you) a statement P that basically says "x happens"
And say we have lots of statements like this, P0, P1
etc
Now another way to interpret the event at P0 is "not P1", which is guaranteed to be a statement
Or, if P1 happens to be true then, too, you could say "P1" instead of "not P1"
It's not important, really
The point is that's another way to interpret what goes on
For example, you're sitting on the grass
Another way to interpret that is "you're not eating potatoes"
Makes sense, right
In fact, for every subset of the statements P0, P1
you have a corresponding interpretation
So the number of interpretations is at least as big as the power set of the number of statements, so, again, too big
JL: This all sounds very abstract and contrived
KMFE: It is, but I don't think it's any more abstract or contrived than a true statement for every thing that happens
Mind you statements are a very human construction
They don't lend themselves to defining the universe
And if you try to use them that way you have to expect to run into mathematical problems
And if you're dealing with a mathematical concept anyway, it's not fair to say that those problems don't matter
YA: It doesn't make biological sense
EKA felt a pain in his stomach when he heard that
That's an old argument
He's heard it many times
He's sick of debating it, but more than anything he's upset that either: 1) YA really believes this argument, which doesn't stack up well for her having thought this through 2) YA does not believe this argument, and is just making life difficult for him, which isn't very nice at all
EKA: OK, I've heard that argument many times before, and am quite familiar with why it is not valid
I'll give you a few reasons: 1) There is a difference between something being natural and being good
2) It's a very naive interpretation of evolution to say that altruism is not natural
Altruism does in fact exist in the real world, which has already been subject to extensive evolution
3) Even if evolution did discourage altruism, that doesn't mean it won't happen, it means it might happen less over long periods of time
4) It ignores the immediate reality that you do in fact care about other people
I know you do
But most importantly, how can I trust you
You claim not to care about me except for your own interest
I can't like that and if you say that then I do not trust you
Maybe I just have such low self-esteem to think that keeping my friendship wouldn't be important to you
But if it were, why would you say something like that
But come on, I know you care about other people
Why'd you warn Michael about burning himself on the hot glue gun
Oh, you'll probably say because it was in your interest to do so
And you know what, it probably was
But that's not the only reason, is it
Doesn't anything go deeper than that for you
Heck, maybe it doesn't
I'm kind of feeling spiritually dead now too
I just want to say that I can't trust you if you don't care
Maybe I'm all screwed up and wrong but hey that's part of reality too
That's part of that intransigent world that you have to bend to your self-interest
So goodbye
YA said he could go care about other people all by himself
She'd have no part of it
She stopped talking to him
And that really hurt EKA
But it was his fault now
He'd made an issue out of it
I mean, how petty was he that he couldn't trust an Objectivist
A person's philosophy does not define their whole life
And he did know that YA really cared about other people
Can't he look past something even if she is stuck on it
Or shadows of memories that only slightly exist
PL and I went to the library with a laptop to get some software from the IFI site
I headed towards one of the tables in the front but she told me no, come to the back
I asked why, and when we got there she answered, because n's here, and n is awesome
We sat down at n's table
She was doing something, I forget what
I headed for the IFI site to get whatever it was
Probably the 04 code
Probably for Pennington Day, or something like that
That would make sense, timewise
That's when Amalie said “You two are so similar it's scary
I shouldn't have let PL take it from me
But I did, and there's no way to repair it
n didn't say anything
I drew the n drawing on friday, but not the first friday
Not the friday when I realized n existed
For awhile I thought maybe I realized she existed before then
Because I had a memory of being at some big party thing for all the teams at a regional, and a bunch of people on my team went outside in the hallway to play cards
And I remember when both n and I scored -8 and she said “we're negative 8 twins” and I didn't know how to talk to people back then so I just smiled back, but I did see her, at least in memory, as someone amazing, who I would love to be any kind of twin with
The reason that that made me suspect my other memory (actually, that was also on a friday, I think) is that I thought that that was in Philadelphia, which would have been a year too early
The evidence I might use to pinpoint the date is: There was some pan-team party an Philly, but it was different
I think I remember Mr
Peles, which would have been at Annapolis
I brought a deck of cards, suggesting Annapolis
I used the big rubber band from my deck of cards to tie up my hair for the card game
I had been having problems with my hair in my eyes at Annapolis, which is why I had borrowed the Miss Daisy headband (which annoyed Scott) and why PL had bought me a bunch of headbands
So I do believe that the day I discovered n is accurate
My only credible memory of her before then is in wood shop, where Jeff introduced me to her
It probably wasn't even until that first friday that I knew her name for more than a few seconds
So on that friday, I don't think I actually drew the drawing
But I might have
It was certainly inspired by looking out the window at people gathered to go to Physics Day, and n was standing there, facing towards me, but I don't think she would have seen me
I was in study hall, alone now that the violent people had left for the semester
I could only look a few seconds, because the sight of her was too powerful
I looked again, and still, too powerful
That's when I knew I had to do a drawing
But I probably waited too long, so the drawing didn't capture the spirit
And I made the mistake of telling PL about it
Telling PL about things can ruin them
I once complained to her about that
Almost two years later, in robotics, :P told me she had to leave early (she leaves early a lot, which I had jokingly complained about a few times) to go to her friend's house
I asked who, and she said n
I hadn't thought about her in a while
That night online I mentioned to PL, “I hear n's home”
Now that's not even just mean to me
It's completely patronizing to n
But I suppose being mean to me was more important than respecting n
Right now he had to send an email to Andrew, and, if he could risk it, to :P
He had to tell Andrew that he was about to disappear, and that he'd try to continue the revolution from wherever he went, but he had to keep that a secret
His reason for contacting :P was less important
He had thought about asking Aditi to help disguise him, since she would have been difficult
But he didn't want her to be drawn in, so he had tried to disguise himself
Cut his hair, shaved, removed his glasses, traded some clothes with his roommate
Now he was in the New Brunswick Free Public Library, trying to look like he wasn't scared
He gave the person at the desk a fake name for a guest computer session
He didn't know how fast the police could find out about these things
He created a new email account, and quickly wrote the email to Andrew with as few specific words as possible
Could they identify him by his typing style
Were people watching the cameras in the library
Dammit, this would be a good time to know these things, but he had no idea
All he could do was be nervous
He hoped he didn't end up like Jeff Boss
He decided to risk the email to :P, but very carefully
All he said was "Tell Joe [that was Jo] the bible's in the church"
The bible was his notebook, which he had left in the collapsed Presbyterian church
Now that that was done he quickly logged out and left the library
Now he didn't know if he could trust public transit
He didn't need to show ID to ride NJ transit to  New York, but if the police were serious enough they might be checking
And he wasn't confident in his disguised
But he'd look more suspicious walking, and anyway he didn't have much time
Or at least he thought he didn't
He didn't really know how fast the police worked
But the bus would be less conspicuous
People getting on and off all the time
Pay on the bus with cash
So he got on the 815 on George Street and then took the 116 into New York
Then he took a bus from Port Authority (officially you needed photo ID but they didn't usually ask for it) and at 5AM the next morning was in Montgomery, Alabama
Very
So I wrote this shell command to decide which of Jeff's stories to read
It was open "$(find /windows/Users/owen/Desktop/Jeffstuff/ -name '*
doc' | randperm | head -n 1)"  It came up with "getting back w elise
doc", which is the transcript of a conversation between Jeff and Elise (haven't finished it so I don't know how it comes out)
So I start reading it, and I think, "wow, Elise says 'haha' A LOT"
Then I think "Hey, maybe if I can learn enough of Elise's habits I can imitate her when I'm talking to Jeff"
THEN I started laughing Jeff's Evil Plan laugh, all the way down to the posture and hand gestures
And I thought to myself, "what have I become
Zac: If I was really thirsty, the fruit I would most like to find,
would be a water melon, Billy: Well, yeah, it's water melon Z: Banana would be the least B: It's a dry fruit Z: Banana's about the driest fruit I can think of - except for dried fruit B: Yeah, I wouldn't like to find dried fruit Z: [something]'s a fruit
B: Really
Z: Yeah it grows on trees  ///////////////////////// // Ghosts (Encounter with Amalie)  I felt long limp damp cold grass against my foot and leg
It was too cold for spring
It was too light for night
A glow lit up half the heavens, pale eerie light behind the clouds
Pine trees made an outline against the horizon
I thought to speak but had no chance
Against the massive dome of sky I saw the shadow: the huge figure appeared as if it were already there
There wasn't much wind and I heard it call to me but there was nowhere to hide
No pine tree would shelter me from its omniscient eyes and I could not run
David did not understand my fear but I had no time to realize him
I think I screamed but I did not hear myself, as the shadow neared
Below the hanging specter I ran forward to meet her human form
She was threatening but there was nothing else to run to
I grabbed and hugged her, trapped her
Buildings crumbled and burst into flame
People ran; I could almost look her victims in the eye
I jumped back
The sky seemed to lighten to day and the air calmed
There was a single lone figure standing in front of me
Because there was wet paint on the walls
He tried the porch but it smelled like paint too
So he dragged a mattress and blanket out onto the steps
The blanket was too hot, then without it he started getting mosquito bites
He went to sleep in the car on the back seat with the door open slightly (he didn't want to get the keys to open the windows) but the mosquitoes found their way in
At this point he was too tired to move so he just stayed their and let himself get bitten as he fell asleep
The neighbors' house blocks the sun in the early morning
At 11:00 it started shining in the window onto KMFE's face, then moving down towards his feet
Whenever the sun woke him he kind of forgot where he was, and just went back to sleep
Then someone poked him on the foot
So he still wasn't that sure where he was
First he thought he was back home
Then he thought he was on the couch on the porch
Then he realized he was in the car and sat up
The neighbor was standing there
This is the one that David named "the hot neighbor"
Did KMFE ever know her real name, or did he just forget it now
Neighbor: Did you sleep in the car all night
KMFE: Um
well, no first I tried the porch then the steps outside
People were painting inside and it makes it hard for me to fall asleep
Neighbor: And lying on a car seat doesn't
KMFE: Um, well, it seemed better
KMFE realized he'd never actually talked to the neighbor before
So he couldn't be blamed for not knowing her name
Then he noticed she was leading against a lawn mower
It seems like that family is always mowing the lawn, and he had to try hard not to laugh
Neighbor: What's funny
KMFE: Oh, just I didn't expect to see you when I woke up
Neighbor: Well I thought I'd come and alert you before I started mowing
KMFE: Oh, thanks
That's very nice of you
Each day he preached something different
It was usually some sort of joke
By now most people walking by had figured out that it was the same person every day and that he was not serious
Some tried to join him in the game, and most just walked by
The honest preachers resented E1 because they thought he was making fun of them
Many Christians thought he was, by making fun of street preachers, making fun of Christianity in general
They thought he must by a snarky, cynical atheist out to show how much more enlightened he was because he made fun of people instead of fearing for their soles
They resented him for his lack of empathy, and that young impressionable minds walking by might mistake it for enlightenment
Atheists resented him for portraying atheists as a sarcastic bunch who make fun of street preachers
They wished they could say something to distance themselves from his games
They wanted to prove that most atheists really have no problem with religious people
Really sympathetic people wondered how lonely he must be to stand there making a fool of himself every day
He must just like preaching, and he didn't have anything to preach about, not anything he really cared about
KMFE took E1's fliers every day
He kept them in a folder
It was like building E1's philosophical history
Except it was a comical history
But that was probably accurate
At least E1 didn't laugh, and KMFE appreciated that
He still hadn't learned to tolerate laughter
David hadn't shown up yet so Solomon took off his backpack and sat down in front of the table
He wiped an inch of slippery soot from the surface with his arm, clearing a spot for him to write
The table shook at the cacophonous bellow of David's steam bike outside the window
Gravel blasted up by the studded tires drew fresh scars in the glass panes
Two minutes later David trudged into view, hair sopping wet, with plumes of steamy vapor rising from his soot-encrusted clothes
He spat a mouthful of grit into the floor and sat down across from Solomon
It tore apart, and Solomon plunged his fingers in to fish it out, trying futilely to separate the potato from the gravel
In the middle of conquering New Vaporia, King Pistonio interrupted an alien invasion, which has triggered their wrath upon our kingdom of Turbineilles
Consequently Pistonio has asked us to redesign the steam car factory for weapons production
Here, let me sketch the factory in its current layout for you
The pen whizzed into action with a jack-hammer rattling, spraying David's face with a speckled display of ink
Solomon waited for the mechanism to heat up, then proceeded
He tried to piece it back together with chain-link brass tape, but this only made the problem worse
They went outside and hopped on David's steam bike
It was a marvel of technology and art
The exquisite brass-plated gears rolled over each other in perfect harmony, turning chemical energy to swift, linear motion in a kind of elegant dance
Or rather, it could have done that if the whole thing weren't covered in a thick gelatinous ooze, marked and scratched from grit, sand and the occasional projectile sledge hammer, and tragically equipped with a noisy, shaking, belching steam turbine, the heat from which warped and deformed the mechanism from its manufacturing specifications with startling enthusiasm
David and Solomon both wore goggles, helmets and thick leather coats to protect themselves from the onslaught of engineering
They rode into the heart of the city's manufacturing district
Massive rotating shafts carried power from the coal generating plants to the jigsaw puzzle of factories
These phallic symbols of industry, progress and raw, untamed power walled in David and Solomon on either side
Just under two miles form this mess a man named Benjummun Frankly was busy preparing a kite and a key in a way that would transform the industrial jungle beyond recognition, but for now that was just a far-off wisp of steam in the sunset
Against all odds they finally reached the factory, where they arranged a meeting with King Pistonio
But where does the steam come from
But where does the coal come from
From organic matter, whose energy comes from the sun
It's one big orgy of thermodynamics
But the real question is, how did we end up in a low entropy state
Does it derive from the Big Bang, or was it a random fluctuation
It's all about steam
Jeff: What was it
me: People with cystic fibrosis live an average of 37 years
Jeff: Do you have cystic fibrosis
He always seems to think I'm sick and dying
me: No
There was a bit of a pause
me: Jeff, yo know AU has cystic fibrosis
Jeff: No, I didn't know that
She always said she had a condition
Jeff: When'd she tell you
me: She didn't tell me
Jeff: Who told you
me: Steve told me
Jeff: AU told Steve
me: She did a presentation on it in bio
There was more silence
Then we came up to the path that leads down behind the stadium, where there's still lots of construction
Some time after we had been running again Jeff brought up the topic again
Jeff: You know how sometimes you learn something, and you wish you hadn't
me: Yeah
I do
That's how you feel about this
Jeff: yes
Much later I brought it up again
me: I always thought one of the perks of studying engineering is that when I'm 50 or 60 I can be one of those old engineering guys who know everything
Jeff: Yes, and
me: Well if you don't live that long that takes a lot out of it
Jeff: Or if you don't go around squeezing cute boys
me: I guess that depends on your preference
Jeff: KMFE, you're priorities are all messed up
We didn't talk about it again, except Jeff asked for clarification at one point Jeff: 37
me: Well actually 36
8, but yeah
He also asked me why I'm at Rutgers
Like shouldn't it be a good investment to borrow the money and go somewhere else
Well, the best I can say is that it depends on how worth it it is for me
I think so long as I can work on programming by myself it won't matter what I end up doing
He hummed a few notes
EKA: Yeah, that's a good one
Jo: You mean you play that song together and you don't know what it's called
KMFE and EKA looked at each other
KMFE shrugged and shook his head
KMFE: I don't know
I don't know if anyone ever told me the name
I learned it from listening
EKA: Yeah, me neither
When they started playing Jo interrupted
Jo: That's called Sausuma
EKA: Oh
Cool
Now we know
Later that day, EKA: Hey, how about we play that one again, that one that Jo had some name for
KMFE: Right, that one
Sure
From then on they called the song "that one that Jo had some name for"
KMFE: This song has too many notes in it
EKA: It goes faster if you play them all at once
KMFE held down the sustain pedal and smashed his foot on the quiet pedal
KMFE: True, that was a lot faster
EKA: It had a lot of different harmonies
Some interesting dissonance
KMFE: Yeah I think we've run out of ideas
He was resting his head in his hands and was still wearing a thick coat
His pockets were filled with newspaper and books
She took out an mp3 player she had bought two days ago
Set it on her desk in front of her
Pushed a button
Jumped back
KMFE watched and wished she weren't distracted so he could talk to her
MK walked in looking tired and sat down in front of AR
He turned around
MK: Hi AR AR: Hi MK
Did you finish your essay
MK: I'll start it tomorrow
AR: It's due tomorrow
MK: I know
I'll do it before class
AR: I finished mine
I did it over the weekend
KMFE got out Das Kaptial and started reading
Then he took off his coat and went back to reading
He glanced at AR for just a second
He'd try and say hi to her later
David and Chris walked in with takeout
It made the room smell like food
AR was hungry but she didn't want to eat anything
MK asked for a fry
David said something in a faux-cocky voice and handed one over
KMFE wouldn't have time to eat before his next class
David and Chris hadn't started their essays either
They weren't worried
KMFE had several pages of stream-of-consciousness thoughts
He didn't understand his strategy, but somehow it worked
It was more about thinking than about writing
David and Sonali started arguing about whether there had been a police officer in the dorm the previous night
More people came in and not everyone could sit where they wanted to
The professor set lots of stuff on her desk and started moving papers into piles
She took a drink from her gallon seltzer bottle
Everyone wanted to get out of there for some reason
The professor didn't enjoy this class
The students were all in the engineering school and didn't like writing
AR wanted to go back to her dorm room
It was nice and peaceful there and people didn't ask you to do things
You didn't have to talk there
But KMFE thought it was worth it to be there because AR was there
She even lived on the same floor as him but he'd never see her in the dorm
Here he could at least talk to her
Though he didn't
He wished she didn't want to leave, but if he could have got her out of there, he would have
KMFE put away Das Kapital
David and Chris finished their takeout and threw away the styrofoam trays
AR put away her mp3 player and got out the New Humanities Reader
KMFE decided to say hi to her after class
So this is what we learned before about KMFE: A long time ago PL had offered to protect KMFE from NL
KMFE, like a fool, had told NL this
It got silence (or something like it) from NL
So KMFE had always thought that the reason NL reacted negatively to the appeal to authority (PL's authority) is that it was an appeal to something outside of the game
It wasn't fighting fair
This is problably a good interpretation, but perhaps we can reinterpret
Well, if NL cared about her fight with KMFE, it must be that she cared about KMFE somewhat
So it's not unreasonable for NL to be a bit jealous of PL, but that's a strong word, so let's just say competitive, since NL was competitive with everybody
An appeal to PL's authority is like taking sides, like KMFE saying he respects PL more than NL
Now NL did admit that PL is scary
So another interpretation is that NL was wrapped up in some fight with PL
Perhaps NL recognized that PL could be viral, and introducing her into the fight with KMFE would be bad
Actually, very few people realized that PL can take over situations like that
The few who discover it don't often live to tell about it
We can say two things for sure
First is that it was a mistake for KMFE to bring up PL
He should have kept her out of his relationship with NL
The second is that he had no idea
He simple could not imagine, even if someone had tried to tell him (and someone had), what PL was capable of and how vulnerable he was to it
KMFE had once asked ll if ll had made it a mission to warn people about the dangers of PL
ll had said no
Later, now a victim of PL, KMFE entertained the idea for himself
But he decided it would not be fair
It was the most fair thing he could do to stay out of PL's life
She deserved another chance, if for no other reason than it was not his place to deny her one
But he didn't trust that PL felt the same about him
Daher said it's better not to think about what you would have done differently in high school
He said maybe you would have studied harder for that one test, or asked some special person to prom
But, oh well, you didn't, you can't change it, just do what you can with what still lies ahead
RE: I thought of you when he said that part about asking a special person to prom
KMFE: Oh, did you want to ask me to prom and then never got up the courage
Is that why you thought of me, RE
RE: No, KMFE, you know why I thought of you
KMFE: Yes, yes I do
I think you keep that memory more alive than I do
RE: No, I just like to make fun of you
And you make it so easy
KMFE: Well, I guess for something like this the best thing is to say nothing and then go write a story about it
Then it can sit their like a dream deferred
Or lost, really
Jeff: Dream deferred is from that guy, right
That we read in Mr
Porter's class
Langston Hughes
KMFE: Yes
Where does it go
I don't remember that poem so well, but I think something bad happens to it
Jeff: Yep
I don't remember either, though KMFE: He has another good phrase, in “The Trumpet Player”
That's what my stories are
Ecstasy distilled from old desire
We gathered in a huge crowd and we voted on each issue, one by one
Louis Pagano would call out "nuclear disarmament" and everyone would start shouting "yes
yes
no
And we would do this until we felt that we had enough issues then we would storm the capital screaming "Obama
Obama
We demand nuclear disarmament", or "We refuse nuclear disarmament" if we had voted no
I remember standing there next to Rob Ardito and him asking me "Which did we decide -- yes or no on free trade" and I reply "I don't know, I'm going to try it out at home and see how it sounds" and says "I knew you'd say that
KMFE: Well
At a robotics competition (Annapolis – my sophomore year) I was spending a lot of time entering data into a computer
I got the scouting sheets from the scouts, and put in the numbers
Now this is a boring job
To make it more interesting, whenever I got a sheet with no name on it, I would identify the person by the handwriting, and try to imitate their signature on the sheet
I got pretty good at it
Ellen has a very distinctive way of writing her name
Large curvy E, single line for the first l, then l e n attached
The n has a very specific asymmetry
One time I had a very hard time getting the n right so I kept erasing it and rewriting it
The next scouting sheet I got from Ellen she had erased the n and rewritten it very neatly separated from the rest of her name
To this day I do not know why
Maybe she was making fun of me
Maybe she thought that I didn't like the way she wrote her name (this thought bothers me, since it might be true, and it means she must have thought I was very picky
It also means she was very willing to comply
Like the time I asked if she had been writing in pencil and she immediately took out a pen – no, I really was just asking
She probably doesn't remember because she doesn't care
She was honest because she was scared
It was nice being far away from Kaye and not having to think about :P
But that was not what KMFE was thinking about
Well he was a little south and west of Kaye too but surely not the same amount of one or the other
He was trying to listen to people talking on the sidewalk outside the window
They were obsessing over this guy who had purchased a quantity of weed measured in truckloads and were trying to figure out what that worked out to in g
Now you know it gets confusing being good at something
KMFE wrote in the margin of the schedule, "How come I can do miracles in code but I can't make you care about me
Jo wanted to know what KMFE was planning on for the rest of his life
I had some plan but it wasn't worth remembering
It's better not to be too egocentric, you know
I like that way of looking at it
What was she but what he saw in himself
But KMFE wouldn't think about her now because he wasn't near Kaye or anything associated with it
KMFE said the name to himself slowly, pronouncing each syllable deliberately
KMFE stayed in Egll for one more night then took the train home
He didn't see Jo again until three months later he was on a rooftop in New Ckrg and saw her climb out of a basement across the street
He was just about to head to class and was folding papers into his pockets
He yelled to her maybe loud enough to hear
Jo had been planning a popular revolt in New Ckrg over food prices and was meeting with fellow rabble-rousers in the basement
They were trying to figure out how to avoid getting the support of the Mayor
Jo saw KMFE and crossed the street just barely missing a big red bus
KMFE: Which one
Jo: On Kennedy road
And there was a train coming, and it lit up the tracks all pretty
KMFE: You have described that before
Jo: Yes, I have, because it's pretty
So I don't like to be on the bridge when the train goes under, because it makes everything shake, so I started walking away
Then the whole thing exploded
KMFE: The train
Jo: Well, it turns out there was an explosive gas that leaked out of a tank car from a previous train, and was sitting (heavier than air) below the bridge, because the tracks are sort of in a trench there
And the engines of this train ignited the gas and there was an explosion
KMFE: What happened to the bridge
Jo: The bridge was actually not significantly harmed
I was terrified, though, because bits of rock and tree branches went flying and some hit me
I wasn't hurt, though
Then sirens started sounding and fire trucks showed up
KMFE: Wow
Jo: Haha just kidding there was no explosion
KMFE: Wait, for real
Jo: No, just made that up, there really was
KMFE: Jo, if you keep that up I will quickly stop talking to you
Jo: You could just read about it in the newspaper
KMFE: This is true, but that doesn't stop you from just saying what actually happened
Jo: No really I just made the whole thing up about the explosion
KMFE: Why
Jo: Because wouldn't that be so cool
If you were walking away from a bridge and it suddenly erupted in fire
KMFE: It would be exciting
Jo: It would be awesome
The only interesting thing I really saw last night was a place where if you stood right there and nowhere else you could see a black line in the sky
KMFE: That is somewhat interesting
That night Jo and KMFE went back to the spot but you couldn't see the line anymore
KMFE: Were you just making that up
Jo: No, I really wasn't
Last night there was some sort of light haze in the sky over that way and the line was like a shadow in the haze
But you could only see it from this spot right here
Jo went back the next few days and it wasn't there any of those times either
She guessed there must have been car headlights or something that one time
Jo: Too bad it's not always there
That would be a cool way to give instructions to meet somebody
KMFE: How many people do you plan to be meeting at midnight on Kennedy Road
That's kind of in the middle of nowhere
Jo: Man, that's another problem
I don't have any spooky covert plans that need to be done in the middle of nowhere
Jo: There was the time when me and my mom had to leave our home in Louisiana in the middle of the night because we were afraid my dad might try to kidnap me
KMFE: Where did your dad live
Jo: On another street in the same development
This place had an alarmed fence around the whole thing
But my brother knew how to get around it
After that we moved up north
KMFE: And since then nothing's been exciting
Jo: Oh, it's been plenty exciting
I'm glad I don't have to be escaping in the middle of the night
There were other bad things in Albartown (that's the name of the place in Louisiana)
KMFE: Is that where you wrote the poem about drowning
Jo: No, I wrote the poem since we moved
But that is where I almost drowned
KMFE: So the poem wasn't entirely metaphorical
Jo: I guess not
Jo: What happened
KMFE: Well, so it's not unusual for someone to say hi to me and I don't know who it is
Jo: That can be awkward
KMFE: Well I get used to it
But this time when he realized I didn't remember him he said " you met me at your grandma's house"
Which made me think I really ought to know who he is
Heck maybe he's my cousin or something
Jo: Did it turn out he was
KMFE: No, his family's renting the house
Now I remember him
Of course, meeting people again hasn't always been awkward
Just today I was running along Davidson Rd and I heard screaming somewhere behind me
First thought that came to my mind is "great, somebody's yelling at me just to be rude", because people do that and it's really annoying
Then I figured they probably weren't directing the yelling at me
Then I heard my name
It was IL, who I haven't seen in forever
And of course she's one of the few people who would actually say hi to me in that situation
There's someone I barely talked to last year, I think I can remember talking to her once, and online just before school started she said hi and acted like she actually knew me really well, but I haven't even seen her
And
could I even recognize her by sight
And then there's JPW, and it was awesome just seeing that he still is more or less how he used to be, and that it's not awkward now that we're not rooming together
Sometimes when you take a relationship into a different context it just doesn't seem right
But it was fine here
But there's plenty still awkward
KLS, well, that seemed awkward all last year and I have no idea why
And
still this year
Nothing's changed
Perhaps that's good
Of course, not being around all those same people from the floor is strange
And
I haven't seen AR
Or even talked to her
And well, that, well, I don't know
And then there's that guy, who was friends with my neighbors, who probably feels obligated to say hi to me, even though he probably doesn't like me
And well I'd just as soon he not
So that's exquisitely awkward
So
now the question, does the awkwardness measure devised before work here
Let's see
Rank these people on how much you'd like them to be here now pretending no awkwardness: AR, ABB, CHL, KLS, IL, DP, JPW
AR CHL IL ABB JPW DP KLS  That's very hard to do, because it's a rather unrealistic situation
Now with awkwardness
CHL JPW IL ABB DP AR KLS  So, difference in ranks: AR -5 ABB 0 CHL +1 KLS 0 IL 0 DP +1 JPW +3  I just don't think those numbers look right
OK, time for a new way to measure awkwardness
And we'd figured out all our orders, and got the money together, which took a long time, and then Jeff pointed out we should have called first so it would be here sooner
Someone had to call
We did a nose call, but some people didn't like that, so we used a random number, and some people didn't like that
So finally I agreed to call under the condition that next time we all agree to the random number
So five of us in the room, so badly don't want to use a phone we have to come up with these strategies to come up with a victim
Not as inconvenient as the time Michael called with Jesse's phone, and didn't know the number when they asked him
But anyway, then going to get the food I saw Gowri and Devleena and Neha
And I need to go visit Gowri and Samiha and whoever else is living with them some time, and I should have done that today but I just feel like staying in my room programming
Because that's what college is for
Like it's actually a pleasant way to spend the day, not talking to hardly any people, just working on the computer and occasionally leaving to go to the dining hall
And I really ought to call Audi some time
Man, there's so many people I want to see, and really ought to see, but just don't want to
endure the excitement
And
I haven't seen Tessa
Though I have talked to her
Man I ought to go see so many people
I should just transfer to a school where I don't know anyone
Wait, I sort of did that
I mean, aside from Jeff, nobody I see frequently I knew before coming here
Is there no escape
Well, I mean, would I really like not knowing anyone
That's a tricky question
You and Deon told me I was free
I disagreed, and you correctly guessed there was a story behind it
In ninth grade I did not talk to many people
I rarely saw anyone outside of school
I was very alone but I did not mind this
I did talk with many people online
I could hide that I was only in ninth grade, and talk philosophy, religion, politics, and morality
This was very nice
But it didn't enter in to real life
This was also when I met Jeff
At first I didn't pay much attention to him
What eventually got me interested was that he was perceptive
He noticed things
This was unusual for anyone – most people are oblivious
If you wonder why I make fun of him now, that goes back to ninth grade
Because he was mean to me (or rather, he was honest)
He made me realize how alone I was
And even if I was still happy, I was no longer content, and this feeling stayed with me
When I started to care about other people, it meant I was no longer free
Soon I started to care about everyone
But what happened to the people who needed me
That is a tragedy in need of a story
It's not that other people don't understand
They do understand
It's that they don't think it's a topic worth talking about
Other stray thoughts
Realizing my writing style is starting to look like Jeff's, just a little
OK, but what was the stray thought
I like people who can just talk on and on about something without worrying too much about whether someone's listening
I really do enjoy listening to them
And man would it be unfortunate if they got self-conscious and stopped talking
People who are visibly uncomfortable in social situations but who are obsessed with politics
That seems like
an unfortunate state of affairs
I am the person who is uncomfortable in social situations but who does things that do not require interacting with people, like programming
So I've matched my interests to my skills, or the other way around
Or I just got lucky
Because, well, a lot of people end up really interested in things they don't end up being good at
I hear a lot of people say they really love physics, but can't handle all the math
That seems to me unfortunate that math is such a barrier, since although nature is intensely mathematical in its character, it runs just fine whether math is used to study it or not
Well, there was a time when I was into politics
And I faded out of that because I couldn't speak in front of people
I wonder if some people just have more perseverance than me
Were confronted by the same situation a long time ago, and stuck with it instead of backing out into programming
I assumed that she had a job now, and things to keep her busy, and distracted
She could still be a magical person underneath, but all that could be hidden in her new life
I got her drawing out of my backpack
It wasn't a self-portrait, but I believed that she saw herself in it
It showed who she was, nondescript and largely unknown, one small person in a large world, an amazing secret
Even if she had forgotten the thoughts that went into that drawing, I could see that at one time, she dreamed
I was standing outside the door to her apartment now, on the fourth floor, still not sure if I should knock
I remembered there were many times, since I last saw her, when I avoided talking to her, because I didn't want to change the story
A drawing is a scary thing to look at, because each mark on the paper was something made by the person who drew it, and there are a lot of them
Every line is like a thought
And it won't be repeated, but it's there if you can read
The figure in the drawing wasn't even female, I realized, but it was still n
He sat on the curb looking up at the sky
I wondered if you could see the sky from n's apartment
There might be buildings in the way
This is a big city
I knocked
Actually, was it more to worry that n might be less powerful, or that I might be less weak
But when I knocked the decision couldn't be unmade
Actually, that's better
If I don't knock, I still have the option of knocking, so I still have to make a decision
Once I've knocked there's no more decision
But 'should have' and 'shouldn't have' can be exhaustive
Turning away without knocking, I would know I should have knocked
A 'should have' is a sad but beautiful thing, a sort of dream, a potential life undisturbed by example
A shouldn't have is a much colder thing
This was a shouldn't have
Or like the table for some debate club
They had this quote on their sign, something like "it's better to have a question debated and not settled than settled but not debated"
KMFE tried to start an argument
He asked them about California
They keep debating and not settling things, because they require 2/3 vote
But the guy at the table wouldn't get into an argument
I mean they're a debate club, right
So KMFE went over to the philosophy table
That was so easy he barely had to try
The guy would argue with anything KMFE said
He couldn't even say one sentence without the guy taking issue with every word of it
And he said the most mystifying things
Philosophy guy: So, you believe you have a hand
KMFE: Um, yeah, I guess so
Philosophy guy: Come on, you really believe you have a hand, right
I mean, if you were about to fall, you'd put out your hand to stop yourself
KMFE: All right, whatever you say
Philosophy guy: OK, so how certain are you that you have a hand
KMFE: Um, well, I feel pretty certain
Philosophy guy: So are you more certain that you have a hand, or that you're not a brain in a vat having reality fed to it
KMFE: Oh man I have no idea
Philosophy guy: Come on, be honest
KMFE: Look, whichever you want it to be, just make it that one
I'll go with whatever
KMFE never found out which one he was supposed to pick
He was just trying to ask why math works
And the truth seems to be that nobody knows why math works
KMFE unfolded the piece of paper and looked at it
Then he looked back up at EKA and smiled
EKA cringed slightly and looked away
He glanced up at :P
She briefly made eye contact then looked away
EKA walked out of the room and KMFE followed
Outside it was raining
EKA got out an umbrella
KMFE did not seem to notice the rain
EKA felt very cold
They sat at the bus stop not talking
The bus got in an accident
They stood outside for three more hours in the rain
KMFE stared at the Delaware the whole time
EKA thought eventually he'd have to get bored and look at something else, but KMFE watched the river for three hours
When a bus finally came KMFE didn't get on it
KMFE walked two blocks to the bridge, then into the middle of the bridge and stood there, watching the river
He tried to imagine that n was standing next to him, also watching the river, but he couldn't
She didn't exist for him anymore
He wasn't really sure if the n that he knew ever existed
Perhaps he just made her up
So that n did not exist for herself
Or for anyone else
She once existed for KMFE, in a strange symbolic story, but not anymore
She's gone entirely
Most of human history is lost entirely
Most dreams are forgotten
Most people are forgotten
Millions of years from now it won't matter if the story of n was lost
KMFE tried to look at the river and think of Crossing Brooklyn Ferry
How many people had stood here wondering about a lost dream
But his mind felt blank
John Hurum says a website about the primate Eda got 1
2 billion hits
Do these people want to recover the lost memory of evolutionary history
But more importantly, did someone know Eda, and idolize her, and dream about her, and form an imaginary story about who she was
Last time Jeff tried telling a story and KMFE was around it didn't go very well
The two-member audience thought it was one of the worst stories they had ever heard and criticized it relentlessly
This one didn't go much better
Jeff talked about people he knew back in Hopewell, and the sifnificance did not get through to RK
So KMFE tried telling the n story, but that didn't go well either
KMFE suspected that RK didn't like the stories because she was looking for an interesting plot
He thought she should use the stories to learn about Hopewell
RK simply said "that's not the problem
The problem is you guys suck"
Jeff was rather discouraged
KMFE met RK three months later
She didn't remember Jeff or listening to stories
She vaguely remembered KMFE but it turns out she was thinking of someone else
KMFE and RK were giving campus tours to middle school students
It turns out middle school students can be pretty annoying and are naturally not too interested in a college campus
He wondered if it would be the last real flashback he would ever have about her
The next day he went to talk to Bill's class
After talking he approached AU
He guessed he'd probably hit on the ambiguous end
He usually hoped that if he asked things very briefly and clearly the raw shock would provoke understanding
This is not a realistic expectation
Jeff had said that AU had had the choice between behaving in an expected way and behaving in a 'right' way, and that she had given in and taken the expected way
Jeff also thought that this did seem to be the wiser choice, but it wasn't for him
It had changed AU
EKA imagined that AU would see through his cryptic question, and understand what they had in common
Then right there they would make a pact to give up behaving as expected
And they'd tell each other whenever they broke the pact, and it would preserve their motivation
AU had no clue what he was talking about
Swallowing his disappointment, EKA started to explain
I think he sees them in a philosophical light when they're really mundane
He's a very philosophical person
from W800_death_after:  The owner of the footstep started speaking: "There is some bad news
Come back upstairs, I need to tell everyone
He followed up the stairs to the still air in of the second floor
There were several other people assembled in the still air
The footstep's owner began speaking to them
The foot was silent
John Smith, an longtime employee of NKTC and your coworker, died this morning
When the interruption had passed, she continued,  "If you want to know how he died you can probably find out from the media
It is not pleasant, and I shan't tell you now
Everyone who doesn't need to manage the server is allowed to leave today
Out of the heavens he plucked a stone
This he chiseled with a knife until it was a smooth sphere
He spent weeks pinching and pulling to form mountains, plateaus, ridges and valleys
He breathed clouds of water over the surface, scarring the land with rivers, blanketing it with oceans
The water is always moving
He made plants to cover the land and water, and animals to inhabit every corner
When all ways created he held the earth up among the stars, covered half in sun, and set it spinning gently
Then he stood back and marveled at the creation
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
He spent three years making the heavens
When he started he was determined, focused, with big dreams
As the stars accumulated he became dizzy, unsure of where to turn next
He raced around the sky like a madman flinging stars in and out of existence
He longed for the days when each star looked different
When this was done he rested for eleven years
Then he awoke to finish his task
On the last day God created the earth
No longer tired, and firm in his purpose, he gave the earth land and water and sky
He gave it life, and he gave it people
Now with his task complete, he disappeared forever
In the beginning God found the earth wandering through the heavens
He was entranced by its beauty
He stole it from its meandering course and held it in his hand for days staring at it
For him it was a vast and beautiful mystery
But he soon grew lonely
The surface of the earth was barren, dry and empty
How could it be that this precious sphere that had wandered into his life held no life of its own
How could these secrets endure millenia and be shared with no one
God cried for the lonely planet
And so God resolved to bring life to the earth
He spent years learning how
He drifted through the heavens with the earth in his hand, searching for water and nutrients
After much hard work, God started to plant
Absorbed in his task he created unimaginable diversity of life
Since then the earth was always moving and growing
God placed the earth in orbit around the sun
He was never again lonely
In the beginning God created the earth
Before the earth the universe was cold and unfeeling
God struggled for years to heave rocks of enormous size and fuse them together
He toiled over the land and sea, planting trees, grass, bushes, algae, raising cattle, protecting eggs
It was the greatest task he ever undertook
After immense struggle and upheaval, the earth could stand on its own
God walked proudly through the creation, admiring the delicate complexity that held together
But pride was not his goal
Now was the time to wait
For someday he would have someone to hear the story
In the beginning God grew sick and died
The heavens could not leave a star for his memory, because this would not be right
The solitary God, the enigmatic story drifting through the universe, could never be at home in a shining ball of fusion
For ages after his death, God remained an unrecorded memory
A single planet took up the task of immortalizing the dead ghost
She was to be called the earth
She looked with grim foreboding at the responsibility
She waited days to build up the courage, pacing with agitation
But in her heart she knew that only here, among dreams and emotion, could a faithful tomb be built
And so this young planet accepted God's memory, and the earth was born
In the beginning God created all things
Before creation the universe was empty and nothing existed
After the creation the universe was teeming with movement
No one has ever explained why God did it
Some unreachable force must have acted on God's hand in that moment, something never before seen and never to be repeated
In the beginning God created the earth
He lived on the earth when it was empty of all other life
He wrote down everything he did and saw in a book
He believed it to be the complete history of the world
Long after he died, the world kept moving
It lived out a story many times more impressive than anything written in God's book
God never knew
In the beginning God heard a rumor of the earth's creation
He heard it from a cashier in the supermarket
He went home to sit and think about what that might mean
The world is being created
Didn't he already live in one
This was a time of immense political instability
The earth's population had achieved a negative growth rate due to war, disease and famine
Crops were dying everywhere
People were being displaced from their homes in large numbers
Entire stretches of continent would move from inhabited to deserted and back again in a matter of years
It looked like a new creation would be a good thing
The creation happened forty years after God first heard the rumor in the supermarket
The earth's population had shrunk to several hundred
In a final epoch of flooding the last of the human race was eliminated
God never saw the creation
As the water moved in he could only imagine
In the beginning God told a story
He used to listen to many stories
At the dawn of creation he began telling one
His story has encompassed all that has ever happened
In the beginning God created chaos
Before creation all was ordered and predictable
But God could not be predicted, nor could he be understood
From the beginning it was plain to see the consequences this enigma would have for the universe
With such a spirit in its midst, the world of order could not long endure
In the beginning God was created out of a question
When it rained or snowed or hailed, people wanted to know what the intention was
What was nature thinking
What were her goals
Once set free, this question took on its own life
God became the personification of the goals of nature
In the beginning a lot of time passed
It was 300,000 years before atoms formed
Another 300,000 for stars to form
Billions more for the earth, a few billion for the first life, and hundreds of millions for the first humans
The passage of time allows for many things to happen
It has brought us to where we are today
This made KMFE nervous because it was dark and he couldn't tell if there was a fence
But the dog didn't come any closer
KMFE: I feel sorry for that dog
Jo: Yeah, he's all alone outside at night
KMFE: It's more than that
Here he's got this territorial instinct
He doesn't know where it came from or what it's for
He probably doesn't know many other dogs, he's lived around humans, who act and think differently then him
Now he's alone, bored, neglected, and this instinct surfaces, because he sees us, and he barks as loud as he can, and he keeps barking, it's the only thing that's happened all day, or else it's all been  more just like this, nothing really purposeful to do, just letting some phantom desire fill the void
Jo: You make it sound so miserable
All dogs bark when people walk by
Or at least most do
KMFE: That doesn't mean they're not all bothered by it
Imagine if you grew up around dogs, and you still reacted to some things the way a human would, but you didn't know why, and no one else understood
And anyway I don't like the tone of his barking
It's not just that he's barking, it's the feeling in his voice
Jo: It's a dog, KMFE
You can't treat it like a human voice
There are different rules
KMFE: But
listen
It's still going on
They approached another dog and the same process started
KMFE: Maybe now they'll be barking at each other
It will give them something to do
Jo: Do you think they've ever met
KMFE: I don't know
At least they know about each other
When they were well past the dogs Jo asked Jo: So do you think going out with PL was a complete mistake, and you completely regret it
KMFE: I don't know
Sometimes I think I underestimate how cynical I used to be before I met PL
Jo: What does that have to do with anything
KMFE: Well I sometimes think PL made me cynical Jo: I think everyone gets cynical with time KMFE: That is the kind of generalization I do not like Jo: Why not
It's true KMFE: Supposing I killed you and said "well, everyone dies with time" Jo: That's not the same thing at all KMFE: There's a difference between something happening eventually and happening now
And there's still a right time and a right way for things
Learning how the world sucks is always hard, but there are nicer ways to do it
Jo: Arguably PL is not the world
KMFE had to think about that for awhile
Because it really was true
PL is not the world
But it didn't help him understand things
Eventually he gave it a shot
KMFE: See, the issue is, when I get to know other people well, I start to see elements of PL
That bothers me, because it reminds me of horrible things
Maybe I wouldn't be reminded of bad things if it hadn't been for PL
Jo: What kinds of things
KMFE: Well, I don't know how to say this without making it sound petty
But PL had a funny way with truth
She
was very comfortable interpreting things differently depending on how you want to
Like there are many situations that are sort of open to interpretation, and she'd explain herself one way to one person, and another way to another person, and really believe that both were correct
Jo: Well you succeeded in describing that one with no specific words
KMFE: Oh man, it's just, I don't know, I think the worst of it I'd rather not remember
Jo: That really doesn't sound like the kind of thing that'd be scary enough to block out
She bent the truth a little bit; people do that
Maybe she was a little dishonest, but that happens
KMFE: But
it can matter
A lot
It seems so silly now that I'm out of it
But when I really want to trust her, to the point that I do trust her, and then my trust keeps getting betrayed
And the way I so want to trust her that I am never OK with just not believing her -- I have to argue, and try and make her change her mind
Because what she says and thinks matters so much
Jo: But
just that she stretches ambiguous situations a little
Is that really something to argue over
KMFE: Oh I don't know
That's
what I remember describing to myself before
Or to her
See a lot of this I don't remember the incidents
I just remember how I analyzed them
And it did seem really terrible, at the time
If it doesn't seem terrible now, it's either because the emotion and the power of the situation is gone, or because there is a key detail I am leaving out
I remember what I felt, not why I felt it
Jo: I guess I'll have to trust you
But you can see why I don't like taking your word on this
You've already reached the conclusion, and you can expect me to take it on faith, but I can't use the examples you provide to justify it
KMFE: You caught on pretty fast
Jo: I take it that's one of the things that bothered you about PL
KMFE: It was a struggle for interpretation
As in, we have some anachronistic, enigmatic evidence, not good for proving anything
Now which one of us gets to decide how to interpret it
Jo: It seems at that point you should just admit that you don't know
KMFE: Oh but we thought we knew
Oh we'd talk for hours analyzing our feelings and saying what led to what and how it could be different
And we thought we could really know that kind of thing
Jo: For you, it seems just silly that you'd understand a social situation
KMFE: Thanks, Jo
But PL was really, when you look at it, just as clueless
We were caught up with this delusion that we could talk about stuff and know what we were talking about
It was all so awful
I don't usually like large crowds of people, so I didn't show up until late, and then I didn't intend to stay long
PL was there
Strange to think how late that was, that I was free
Now it's dramatic irony
I talked to her for a little while
I mostly wanted to be back at home, alone, but I stayed to talk to PL
She said it was strange to see Kathy smoking a cigarette
Then I went for a walk around the park
Came back and saw PL again
We were standing uphill from the gazebo, by the path, by the edge of the playground
She told me about n
On the outside n seems peaceful, but inside n is scary
And I didn't like that because
it was a pretend world
KMFE: ok
PL: There's a guy complaining he doesn't like C compared to C++, because "you have to use malloc(), and I've never gotten that to work"
KMFE: Well, I mean, you just
call it
Unless he's talking about implementing it
PL: Yeah I think he was talking about implementing it
KMFE: Well, I mean, that's rarely an issue using C
Unless this is like for an embedded platform
PL: I think it was
KMFE: Well, I mean even then, you'd have the same issue with C++
KMFE: Unless like the C++ libraries are different from the C libraries
PL: I don't know
I just heard that one thing he said
KMFE: Man you really are willing to give someone the benefit of the doubt
PL: What are you thinking
KMFE: Oh nothing, really, just you already said you don't like the truth to spoil the hacker image you have of people around you
PL: That's just mean
KMFE: Yeah, OK, it is
Just well, I mean, how important is this illusion
All around him there was lightening
He saw a small plastic angel from a soft-drink bottle on the ground and picked it up
He asked it to help him survive through the storm
Looking up at the sky he squeezed the angel so the plastic formed white creases
The lightening diminished and the sun started to show through the clouds
KMFE promised the angel not to abandon her after it was over
He headed back up the mountain
Beyond the second hill he met the Goat Man
The Goat Man was a botanist living with goats in the hills
This ecosystem is unique in the world and the blackberries are threatening it, he told KMFE
I wonder if he knows I have an angel in my pocket, KMFE asked himself
That night KMFE suffered every conceivable pain
The lonely bludgeons from C-puff's lair attacked him ceaselessly
He could never tell how many of himself existed
KMFE grabbed the angel off his pillow, tripped down the stairs and out the screen door
You cannot keep an angel
You cannot keep an angel
KMFE threw his undeserved token out of sight into the darkness
He stood silent a minute as the pain dripped away from his body
In the morning he was sure the Goat Man had found the angel
You know how if you've got some big population of relatively uninteresting things (say random strings of text) and you sift through them, if you have enough patience and enough time you eventually see something interesting
So you can apply this to the universe
Imagine being able to go anywhere in the universe instantly, and see anything
It would be the perfect excuse to make up any kind of world imaginable
But there's a problem
Say the protagonist wants to find the most awesome sledding hill
If the universe is infinite, chances are there is no most awesome sledding hill
But let's say the universe is finite
Now there will be a most awesome sledding hill
If it's at least as good as all the ones on earth, it will probably be pretty awesome
The limiting factor is complexity
The more complicated the sledding hill, the more specific the parameters have to be to get it right, so the rarer it is
And eventually it will be too rare and not exist
So that's what sets the upper bound for awesome sledding hill
But say he now wants to find the most awesome place to play hide and seek
Again, this is probably limited by the complexity
But the return on complexity for the two situations (sledding, hide and seek) is probably very different
The degree of awesomeness for the most awesome sledding hill will be radically different than the degree of awesomeness for the most awesome place to play hide and seek
In fact, the two would probably be incomparable, they'd be so different
You wouldn't really get some magical fantasy world with every pursuit – it would be totally haphazard
There'd be no pattern, no consistency
Jo: Well perhaps this could be solved if you invoke the Creator
If the same entity had designed both the sledding hill and the hide and seek place, they'd probably be comparable
KMFE: But that messes everything up
If you've got a creator, the mortal beings lose all relevance
You can try and work it in, but it always feels forced
What's the point of an awesome sledding hill if there's another guy in the story who can make anything
It's like how the story about the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is much better if you take God out of it
The analogy makes sense, but it's hard to buy that God would set up something so clichéd
We were not on good terms then
But she was leaving for college the next day, and somehow we managed to reconcile our differences for one evening and clean out her room
She shared the room with her sister
It was extravagantly messy
It was audaciously messy
The mess had a personality, a history, an ego, and would soon be demanding that it no longer be treated it like a second-class citizen
This was going to be a long evening
I found some papers buried underneath the rubble from two years ago
They were the printout of a long series of pieces about fluid dynamics
There were a lot of equations that I did not understand, but that looked interesting
n's name was on the paper
I put it in a folder, explaining that I wanted to go back and figure out what the equations meant
I must have forgotten to take it home
Then something happened which horrifies me
To this day I can't completely explain it
But it is one of the scariest things I have ever seen
I found a pretty drawn christmas card
I recognized the art style, and asked PL if n drew it
She said ooh yes, and wanted to save it
A little while later I found a card from FSC
I asked PL if she wanted to save it
She looked at me in a disapproving way and said, “I like FSC, but she can get hyper and annoying like WR
I don't need to save everything she gave me
It's ok to save a card from n and throw out a card from FSC
After all, there are always some people among generally close friends who are really special
But to give a reason for it
that's what horrified me
And think about what the reason was
That FSC can act hyper
Surely that can't be what's really going on
To this day I still don't know what the explanation was
I haven't asked PL
I know if I did she'd give some rationalization
She'd be perfectly happy to admit that she was being mean, or petty, but that doesn't help because it's not the real explanation
And yes, I am assuming that there is a real explanation
If I had a drawing from n, I damn well would have saved it, and made sure I'd never lose it
But I have nothing from n, except some old scouting sheets
Actually, there may be small, quick drawings on those sheets
But it's not the same at all
She had stuff in there from a long time back
Six or seven years, some even longer
What surprised me is that she didn't seem at all curious to reconstruct her thoughts
She went through it like it was just stuff
When I read some of her old writing she was careful to remind me how much she'd changed
I have a very cynical theory, which must be wrong because I am an excessively cynical person
I think she had an image for who she wanted herself to be
Anything that didn't fit in with that image, like the old notebooks, and other relics, was an awkward inconvenience
And maybe there's a way to fit the christmas card into that explanation
She saw herself as being friends with n, not with FSC, but she couldn't admit that that was the reason
So she made up something petty, a weakness she was willing to allow herself
This was no ordinary camp story, I was lead to believe
It was the mother of all stories
The horror of all horrors
It was the story of Crazy Jane
The story was legend
Everyone knew of its existence
I am not certain if any of them ever knew the story itself
Come to think of it, I cannot come up with persuasive evidence that the story itself existed
But if it did exist, it was surely the scariest thing ever
One night Adrian gave us his version of the story
I cannot imagine that he had heard much of it from someone else
His account was for the most part pornographic, occasionally meandering into sexual violence and sometimes just regular violence
The main character's name was a racial slur
Finishing the story, he paused, giving time for fear to sink in, then asked us to relate how terrified we all were
We were in fact far more terrified of getting beat up by Adrian than by the story itself, so it was not hard to comply
Years later, still frustrated that no one would ever tell me this holy grail of stories (which must seem like a long time to hold on to bitterness, but it was such a terrific story), I decided to write my own version
I replaced Adrian's "bitchcracker" with Ella, whose character is based on an old enemy of my cousin's named Taylor, and whose name is based on a person who, unfortunately, Adrian's character reminded me of
Actually, Ella is too mean to be the real Ella, and much too nice to be Taylor
My cousin then became the character Antonio, who is quiet and accident-prone
In real life the interaction between my cousin and Taylor was mostly bickering, fighting, and one anachronistic episode of dancing, but I turned it into a sweet romance cut short by ghosts
Rereading the story I noticed it kind of sucked
The only clever part was the subtle use of Antonio's bunk (Mackinac) to indicate his age
To an 11 year old girl, a 13 year boy seems amazing enough by definition to explain why Ella forgives some of the reality of Antonio
But I ruined even that little subtlety by appending the words "raise eyebrows" to the reference
I try to defend my story by claiming that it suffers from actually existing, where it must have actual flaws
Perhaps the power of the story of Crazy Jane is that no one knew what actual horrors it contained, so they were free to imagine whatever they liked
KMFE was standing in the checkout line at a supermarket when someone walked up to him, said simply "reality is all just a big joke, and it's on you", then walked away
KMFE; Well, I knew that was bound to happen sooner or later
Jo: So do you think he was really serious
KMFE: No, I mean honestly most likely he was just trying to bother me
Jo: And it didn't work
KMFE: Well no, because even if he's not serious, it's true
Jo: Reality is all just a big hoax
KMFE: Well, no, not really, but it might as well be
It wouldn't be much different if it were
Jo: That's optimistic
KMFE tried doing the same thing to other people
It would have to be people he didn't know for it to work
That rules out Charlie, who is one of the few people who would really appreciate it
Also rules out Charlie because he'd told KMFE that he expected something like that to happen sooner or later
Jo: So is that why you expected it
KMFE: I uh maybe
Who knows
He couldn't tell how it affected anyone else, so he just assumed that they expected it too
He couldn't see any harm in assuming that
It works, that's the important thing
No, I don't think so
Good code is important
Not saying it isn't
I'm saying all that matters is it works
If it's messy, you won't understand it later on, or won't be able to change it
Other people especially won't
That would be considered not working
Like I said, it works, that's the important thing
I don't think that means anything
I think you defined "work" so broadly your claim isn't falsifiable
Like the standard way to define away altruism
When you do good for other people it makes you feel good, thus not altruistic
It's a broad definition, and it doesn't add anything
Explaining Malcolm Gladwell
Is hard
Specifically explaining how he stretches his arguments a little too far
Someone asked how I liked Malcolm Gladwell
I said I did like him
But he likes to take a little data, and make it go way farther than it should
And that's hard to explain
So they asked what his argument was
And I said he's arguing that people's behavior is less a characteristic of their personality than it is a characteristic of the environment
And that what seems like personality is kind of an illusion
Well I think that's very reasonable, they said
Yes, it is
I agree with that
But you won't understand unless you read it
It's not what he says it's how he says it
Afterwards it's quiet
Too quiet
Except really this time
It's not really awkward
It's just distant
And then silence
And that's sad
I wrote that live, so you can't see the pause, and the event
It's   I wanted to ask like
random stuff that doesn't matter
Dammit
KMFE really just wanted quiet
Or rather, he wanted to not be able to hear any other people
Noise is OK, but there are a few things that are NOT OK:  - The sound of people talking  - The sound of people eating  - The sound of people laughing  - Most other sounds made by people  (he had to admit an exception to this
He remembered, vaguely, enjoying listening to the sound of AR chewing gum)  Right now there were people dowstairs talking kind of quietly
Just little bits of words became audible every now and then
It was still much too much
He tried  - Listening to the radio
No good, the pauses in between words leave room for ambient noise to get in
No pauses in between words, but the song was too much of a distraction
Rather uncomfortable and still let in too much noise
Too tiring
Part of the problem was, that even if he could block out most of the sound, he still knew they were there
Maybe he didn't trust them
He was listening as intently as he could just to see what they were up to
Not because he thought that they might come stab him in the back
More because he was worried they'd do something really stupid and possibly destructive
Like set the house on fire
He went outside and walked around the block
That was hard because on his way out they tried to talk to him
He gave one-word responses and left as quickly as possible
When he got back they were still there
They had settled into a beautiful conversation, talking quietly for probably a few hours now
Must be really nice for them
It wouldn't be so bad if the house weren't shaped in such a way that pretty much all sound downstairs is audible upstairs
Now,  - What is so bad about laughter
Then practical questions,  - What can be done to block out the noise
He reached into his pocket, drew out a ten dollar bill, and slapped it down between them
KMFE: Sell your soul for ten bucks
Jeff: If you can tell me how
KMFE: I'm sure we can figure it out
If you really want to see what happens
Jeff: Well, I think I do
I don't know
I've never had the opportunity to find out
KMFE: I have a suggestion
Jeff: What's your suggestion
KMFE: Put all your stories online, then post a link from FB
Jeff: That
That's selling my soul
KMFE: I think it's the best thing I can think of
First it garantees you a lot of uncertainty
The important thing about soul-selling is you can't espace it
Once it's done you will suffer the consequences
But the consequences also have to be mysterious
If you knew what they were 1) It's just a simple trade
2) There's no reason you'd want to find out
Jeff: I'm pretty sure I know most of what would happen
Most people wouldn't care or wouldn't read it
Some of the people who would read it would get mad, and I'm pretty sure I know who would get mad, and a very small number would find it simply interesting
KMFE: I
would guess you're wrong about that
That's what I thought when I put The Cage online
I thought some people would find it annoying and most wouldn't read it
One person read it
She thought it was hilarious
I thought she would have hated it
Jeff: But
I feel like that's not really a lot of mystery
I mean, even if some people had been offended, that's still not going to be life-altering consequences
KMFE: I think it's more mysterious than you're willing to admit, because you're afraid to do it
How about this: we shufle our stories together and post the whole mix, with no distinction between them, no label for fact or fiction
Or
ask Katie out
Actually let me explain that last one a little more
You're so careful
I mean you do weird stuff, and everyone thinks your pretty weird
But there's so much noise
You say all kinds of stuff
Some of it's true and some of it's misleading
You never take a simple direct action
It's like it's all a game
And that's an OK way of approaching it if that's what you like
But I think you're missing something
Jo: If you could have anyone in the world be here right now, who would it be
KMFE: That depends
Since we're in fantasy land, do normal rules for awkwardness still apply
Because if they don't, n without a doubt
Otherwise, probably Charlie is the only one who could take something like that in stride
Jo: By something like that you mean spontaneously appearing here
KMFE: That's right
Jo: Say they didn't magically appear, they just by coincidence ended up here
And would Charlie really not be bothered by just randomly being teleported
KMFE: Well he has a strong conviction that the universe is messed up in deep ways
I think he'd figure it was bound to happen eventually
But if they were just going to show up by coincidence, are we still assuming regular awkwardness
Jo: Would it be awkward to just show up
KMFE: It could be awkward for me for them to be here
That would still rule out n
I guess then there's a bunch of people that would be cool to just see randomly
No one stands out as extra-special, though
Actually, that would be a good measure of how comfortable you are with different people
First rank them based on how much you'd like to run into them under normal reality, then reorder based on a fantasy world of no awkwardness
Compare ranks
Jo: I take it n would jump between extremes
KMFE: No, I just keep mentioning her because she'd top the no-awkwardness list
Over the past three months the FBI had conducted a sting, posing as a representative of Al Qaeda
Mr
Varley, who owns a manufacturing business in West Virginia, was approached by an undercover FBI agent seeking to purchase a large quantity of "dual-use" equipment
The FBI agent informed Mr
Varley on 8 separate occasions that the supplies would be used as weapons in anti-US terrorist attacks
Semantic Externalist Russel Nguyen will defend Mr
Varley
Mr
Nguyen argues that because Mr
Varley had never been approached by actual terrorists and only by FBI agents, when Mr
Varley expressed approval of selling dual-use equipment for use in terrorist attacks, he was actually expressing approval of selling equipment to an undercover FBI agent
The meaning of Mr
Varley's statements, which were recorded and will be used as evidence in the trial, must be interpreted in the context in which they were expressed, and their meaning is partly determined by external reality
Mr
Nguyen claims that Mr
Varley is guilty of nothing more than cooperating with a US government agency
The FBI is not impressed by Mr
Nguyen's argument
They argue that since the mental state of Mr
Varley was identical to that of a person approached by actual terrorists, within Mr
Varley's own reality a crime has been committed
Since no experiment performed by Mr
Varley revealed a distinction between an FBI sting and actual terrorists, the two situations are one and the same
Solopsist Michelle Clunn argued that the FBI's argument does not go far enough
No experiment performed by Mr
Varley could reveal that he was not a brain in a vat being dropped from a three-story building on a passing pedestrian
According to Ms
Clunn the Justice Department should be prosecuting Mr
Varley for all crimes that experiment cannot rule out
In response to criticism from Mr
Nguyen that this would be "a mockery of innocent until proven guilty", Ms
Clunn said "we cannot rule out" the possibility that someone has proven Mr
Varley guilty of all these crimes
The case has been dubbed a "philosophical judgment day"
Mr
Varley will be tried by a federal district court in West Virginia
Perhaps more than once
I don't think I can recall it well now
I wanted the stories to capture things as they happened
This is because I did not capture the library scene as it happened
Years (do I even remember well enough to count
I have NO IDEA when the library scene happened) passed, and then I wrote about it from memory
That was a year ago (or less
it was less)
At that time I could recall it well, and the emotions meant something
Now I cannot recall it
I cannot visualize it
The most I can say is that I sat on one side of the table, PL to my right, and n across
And that I asked PL can I changed settings for Firefox on this laptop (must have been hers, under the Spike account), and she said change whatever you like
Then n said that that must make me very happy
Then PL said "you two are so alike it's scary"
And that line stayed with me ever since
Jeff: I am
Sweet
Jeff: Wait, how am I a heretic
I feel like I might be a heretic, but definitely not a dangerous heretic
Unless you're talking about Lisa
EKA: You're philosophy could get people in trouble
It almost got me in trouble
When I go outside late at night the police sometimes give me a hard time about it
They don't think I should be out in the dark and cold with no shoes
On Tiler road a cop car drove past me one way, went to the end of the road, turned around and came back
He stopped in the lane opposite me and I stopped and asked him what's up
Why are you running now
See, the first key to enlightenment is coming to terms with the fact that you know nothing
Completely accepting that fact
But once you get there, you realize it's not quite right
First, because you don't really know that you know nothing
You can't be sure of it
And then because so many things seem right even though you don't know them for sure, that there must be something there, even if it's vague and uncertain
It's monotonous, and doesn't give you many distractions
It's a way to achieve enlightenment
In fact, I think that's part of the reason I run more now than I walk
Because I got bored with how slow walking is
I think he thought I was on drugs
He asked me a lot of questions about what I was doing and why I was outside, why I wasn't wearing shoes, do I usually not wear shoes when I run, etc
Philosophy is a dangerous thing
It doesn't even matter what it is
If you think, people get suspicious
There just aren't that many people who actually use violence
Jo: Or no one's a pacifist, because everyone benefits from violence perpetrated by other people
KMFE: That too
Let me show you what I came up with
Radical Pacifism by KMFE  Never use physical force against another person
Never threaten another person
Never use force or threats in self-defense
Do not invoke other people's force (such as law enforcement) for any purpose, including self-defense
Do not hide to protect yourself from others
Make it publicly known that you will not act to defend yourself from others
The heart of radical pacifism is to trust humanity, and be vulnerable to humanity
It does not mean submitting to other people, or obeying other people
It means putting your safety in the good will of other people
You can't help that the country you live in is defended by a military
You should try not to let that influence your decision of where to live
Dangerous places are dangerous because of what other people, just like yourself, have done and are doing
You are no better than them
Radical pacifism is about having no secrets
You should make your life an open book
You should answer every question asked of you
You should never lie or mislead
You should never lie by omission, even to strangers
Radical pacifism is personal
It is not a service to others
It should not be a burden you place on others
If other people depend on your survival, you should not discard them for an ideology
Radical pacifism is not a virtue
It does not make you a better person
It something you do only for yourself
It is like dreaming
Jo: That sounds extremely dangerous
Why would anyone ever do that
KMFE: Why do you dream
Jo: Dreaming isn't dangerous
KMFE: Maybe you haven't dreamed enough
But he forgot about it the next day
He didn't have anything else to do until classes started, so he went to talk to Jo
KMFE: What do you think would happen if a person just stayed in their house for weeks at a time and never went to see anyone
Would it force them to be creative
Jo: I would get bored, and stop being able to think anything interesting
KMFE: I'm thinking of trying it
Jo: Well you have two days
KMFE did try and it didn't make him more creative
A few weeks later, completely bored, he got a bunch of people to form the Committee for a Reasonable Communist Revolution
During all this time he had no further encounters with :P, and never managed to remember about his lost notebook long enough to go find it
At times he imagined an ordinary person (he didn't have firsthand evidence that those existed, but he assumed they must) finding it and being appalled by its contents
Actually it was mostly math, so it would hardly be appalling
And all the good parts were in code
As usual, he neglected to tell either AR or Jo about the CRCR
This was simply because he forgot
The whole thing probably wasn't going to go anywhere anyway, so it would hardly matter who knew
And life could be so exhausting he really wasn't going to remember everything
Trying to work with the KDE source code (there are so many bugs that need fixing) was particularly tiring
Like it took hours to build
The table was filthy with butter and bread crumbs and sugar and there were ants crawling all over it
KMFE thought about cleaning it but his dad hadn't unpacked the dustpan yet and KMFE didn't know where to look
On the counter was a mountain of unwashed dishes, soda bottles (he hoped his dad didn't go back into the soda-drinking phase; that was disgusting), and pieces of food
Some rancid pancake batter with a moth in it fermented in the corner
From his old room KMFE could hear his dad playing an Irish tune on a guitar
His dad worked late every night, got up early every morning, and did things like play guitar most of the day
KMFE wanted to keep the kitchen clean but right now he was just staring at it
He knew his brother wouldn't clean anything
His brother didn't do any work unless he had to
There was that time that KMFE and his brother were alone in the cabin for a week, but KMFE didn't trust his brother to keep things clean so tried to do things before his brother got a chance
What was KMFE's brother going to do
Was he going to stay in college, concentrate enough on classes not to fail
But it was less likely he'd be able to pay
KMFE's mom's husband might not keep his job much longer; KMFE's dad might not, either, or might not live much longer
And could KMFE's brother make himself work to pay for college
Possibly not
KMFE turned off the bright lights and crossed the room to turn on the hanging overhead lamp
Where there used to be the picture of the man in Ecuador there was a fly swatter
KMFE's mom had said she hated tearing up her children's house like this
It made her feel evil
And what KMFE had thought was, it's terrible to make her feel evil, especially now she's living out of town where it's more alone and your own feelings matter more
But KMFE just couldn't do anything about it
EKA flowed into a seat near the back
KMFE stood by watching
Someone near the front was talking, tearfully, emotionally
She was talking about how beautiful this whole community is, how a tragedy really brings out wonders
Now people were standing
The person at the front got them standing with her pathetic speech
She called out one group at a time to praise
First the people who worked miracles this week, and then next week, or worked even better miracles
Look how many angels there are
EKA was still sitting
He hadn't worked any miracles
She finally got him
He had made flag pins
That got the last handful of people to stand up, since it had been required by the school anyway
He might as well have been overcome with sadness so no one bothered him
We are too proud right now to act normally
KMFE took his place in the audience
Of course no one could hear him
People started sitting down and KMFE stayed standing
You are giving them feelings they never would have had
You are creating animosity”  But angels cannot hear you because they have no sense of time
Soon they all flew back into the sky, leaving KMFE standing there in the empty auditorium
EKA walked back in
Kant: and, you can feel free to forward Kant: i don't think she has my email address anyway Kant: but the thing is
one of those is a complete lie Kant: which may or may not bother me Kant: and could possibly cause problems  INTERPRETATIONS  The lie is that you don't have AR's email address
It will bother you because it is a lie
And it will cause problems while you and AR go on your romantic adventure I will be left not even knowing you ever talked to her
When I found out I'll feel cheated out of a good story
Or maybe it's more than just a good story
Maybe I will be overcome with jealousy
And because you know this, it adds a new meaning to "which may or may not bother me"
Because you know your real intentions in hiding the truth, but try to tell yourself it was just an accident
Or maybe the lie is that I can feel free to forward this all to AR
And it's going to bother you because you don't want her to read it
Because it talks about her in unflattering terms
Or it talks about her in glowing terms, or erotic terms, to the point that it would be supremely awkward for her to read it
And there's no need to explain how that might cause problems
Or the lie is not actually in one of those two statements, but in one of the things you sent me
You're afraid I might believe it, and turn it into a weird story to tell AR, in my misguided attempt to set you two up
Like Jerry Seinfeld telling a woman that George is a marine biologist
And that's really going to bother you, because things could have gone so well, if only you didn't have to keep conforming to this lie
Or the lie is in one of the things you sent me, but it's not that you're worried me or AR will believe it
You're worried that NSA wiretappers will believe it
This would be especially bad if AR ever got a job in the NSA and got clearance to view the intelligence reports
She'd have the awkward position of explaining to the agency what's really going on, and that would be uncomfortable for everyone
Also a sign of something original
I just saw an ant try to climb up my laptop screen and fall off
You could see it starting to lose its grip and struggling to stay on as it climbed higher
It shook back and forth as its legs alternately stuck and unstuck
Then it dropped
I always dreamed of being one of those people like Larry Wall who make this really weird software tool that just makes everyone want to psychoanalyze them
Chuck is turning out to be pretty weird
Unfortunately it's a very special-purpose language, and those tend to be weirder than general-purpose ones
Perl is a brave exception
The police have realized that "that kid who walks around barefoot" is not breaking into houses
I walked by a police car today and they didn't even say hi
Some people notice things
There's the old story about Jeff, where someone walked into Spanish with a pen in their hand, and Jeff notices that usually pens that look like that have a push-button but this one doesn't
I later learned this to be intentional
But Jeff in general notices things that most people don't
I was playing hang-man with some people, and Brian made a word with 8 letters
When I counted them Jemma asked if I had put my thumb in the middle to split it into groups I could count by eye
I never noticed I did that before, but I think it's a habit I acquired from counting things on a computer screen, where they're so tiny and it's really hard to point to each one individually, so I split them into groups with my mouse cursor
TDCP: What story
KMFE: About how you are no longer free
You said the people who needed you – it's “a tragedy in need of a story
But I don't know if I can tell it
TDCP:
TDCP: What if he's dead
My story is all that's left
TDCP: OK that's not true
There are other stories
But mine is special
There was a time when I talked to almost nobody, and he was one of the few people who I mattered to
TDCP: Because his life was in a turmoil
His parents recently divorced; his dad moved away
His sister was a prostitute, his parents were both sort of crazy, and all sorts of stuff I didn't know about
TDCP: He once asked his sister (I heard him, on the bus) “Do you ever thing, what if this doesn't stop when we die, and we keep having to live this over and over again
KMFE: But it sounds like you didn't know him that well
TDCP: I didn't
KMFE: So how did you matter
TDCP: Because I was clueless
Everyone else could judge him, because they knew what to judge him by
I knew nothing
I played with him a lot, and it helped that I didn't know him too well
TDCP: But as I said, when I lost my freedom, I failed him
KMFE: Can you tell that part of the story
TDCP: I can try
TDCP: When I met Jeff, I started to care about other people
He teased me into it
KMFE: It sounds like that would have helped
TDCP: I don't know how to explain it
But I didn't see Mark after that
Except briefly and we didn't talk
KMFE: That could have happened for any number of reasons
TDCP: It happened
no
I do know why
I just can't prove it to you
But I do know
I really do
KMFE: It just sounds to me like a fairly typical story
You were in high school, you were growing up, your life was changing, and so was his, and you just drifted away
TDCP: If I'd stayed clueless it wouldn't have happened
KMFE: Well, no one does stay clueless
Everyone starts out knowing nothing and then knows something
Why don't you call him up and ask him how he's doing
TDCP: Because he'd know why I asked
KMFE: Are you afraid of that
TDCP: It would be patronizing
KMFE: It's sort of patronizing just thinking about it like that
TDCP: I was captivated
By people who pretend to be scary
KMFE: If that really was the reason, then I think it was right to judge them scary
But I don't think that's really it
TDCP: Because you don't know
You weren't there
TDCP: And one time
one of the last I saw him
We were in 8th grade, about to become high schoolers
TDCP: And we were touring the high school
The entire 8th grade, split up into groups, went around to see the classrooms and the gym and stuff
TDCP: He decided that I must be scared in this unfamiliar place, and that he would protect me
13)
EKA: I must disagree
There is something forgiving in the water
I've never been baptized in a religious ceremony, but I have experienced something much like baptism
He looked at n, remembering that she was there that day, and the role she played
EKA: I was forgiven for one crime, and committed another
And that one I've never been forgiven
I doubt I ever will be
I can remember what I was singing, and what I was thinking
EKA: It's so ironic that
He thought about PL
The hand sign he remembered n making
He hadn't forgotten about n, at that time
That was
just before he forgot about her
If only he could have preserved that
So then he cared more that n made a sign than for what the sign meant
If only that had never happened
EKA: Silent worship is a way of achieving a goal; it's not the goal itself
So washing, running, other activities can give the same experience
Makes me think maybe I should have done cross-country in high school
EKA: Howard Brinton thinks that the presence of several people during worship is important
I've always wondered about that
But for my baptism, it certainly mattered
Jo: There's this guy called Peter
He was always scared of forgetting things, because if something is never recorded and then forgotten, it is gone permanently
KMFE: Or if it's recorded and everyone who can read it dies off, or if all life goes extinct
Jo: Well, Peter's thoughts weren't that big
He just didn't want to forget parts of his own life
KMFE: Sounds egocentric
Jo: Perhaps, but yours is the perspective of one who won't even think what he intends to do tomorrow because it is too 'egocentric'
I think Peter's fear is justified somewhat
What happened in your past defines who you are now
It's relevant
Just ask PL
KMFE: I did
Jo: I know
Jo: Anyway, he records everything he says
Saves the recordings by date and time, and uses speech-to-text to make them searchable
Jo: But it gives him a new power
When he gets in an argument with someone about whether, say, they agreed to play by NZ rules or Japanese rules, he can go and prove it
Jo: But most people back down, because somewhere inside their head, most people know when they're lying
They just don't know until they have to
And Peter knows when he's right, so he won't argue unless the tapes will back him up
The tapes resolve disputes without being consulted
Jo: Until he starts dating this girl who doesn't back down
She doesn't care what the tapes prove
She will argue anything, as if she really believed it all
When the recordings prove her wrong she will try to reinterpret them
Jo: Peter can't take it any more
He stops recording his life
He likes it better leaving his arguments with this girl up to interpretation
KMFE: So what, then, he loses parts of his life because he's not recording any more
Jo: Well, he does, but it's not such a hard loss, really
He was just scared of it
KMFE: I tell you how I'd finish that story
His relationship with this girl falls apart very badly
And it makes them both very hurt and upset for a long time
And he's somewhat happy about not having a recording, because it helps him forget
KMFE: But this makes him dwell on it
He likes to conjure up the unhappy memories because they are powerful and real
So he remembers that time far better than any he has recorded
KMFE: Honestly, I don't know
KMFE: There may not be a right way to end that story
Sooner or later someone is going to try to send me a really secret message, such as warning me that the mob is after me
What if they disguise themselves as a fortune teller to deliver the message
Then I won't believe them, something bad will happen, and either I'll be killed by the mob or end up horribly superstitious
It's just not worth the risk
Some time in the middle of the night I had an idea for a great story
I was really tired and I sort of had a headache, so I stumbled across the room (not turning on the light), got my notebook, and scribbled my idea where I thought there might be a blank space
I wrote "cooking"
I have no idea what this means
I tried picturing every situation in my life that involves cooking
Mostly it's something anticlimactic like cooking
So perhaps it was a fictional event involving cooking
I could have been cooking the Yeti I had hunted down and killed with my own hands
But in that case I probable would have written Yeti
My first thought of the keyword had just been "cooking"
David says I shouldn't write fictional versions of real events
Or rather I shouldn't "misrepresent" them
Then he angrily left to go to the bookstore
When he got there there was caution tape around it and police cars in the street
He snuck under the caution tape and went inside
It was empty
They didn't have textbooks out in the front and there were no employees, so that was not helpful
He tried to sneak back out but the police wouldn't let him
They assumed he must have been in the building the whole time
He asked them, even if he had been in the building the whole time, why would that mean he can't leave
That didn't get him anywhere
So imagine you wrapped a giant cable around the equator
The change in flux would generate heat
PL: You wouldn't think it would be very much, though
The earth's magnetic field is so weak
KMFE: But think how big the earth is
Later that day KMFE went and did the calculation
7e-8 % Ohm*meter  L = 2*pi*Rad Res = Resistivity * L / Cable_Area I = Emf / Res Power = Emf^2 / Res  % Sources % [1] Wolfram Alpha % [2] http://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  It produced the following results: B =  5
0000e-05 Rad =  6378000 T =  328500000 Area =  1
2780e+14 Flux =  6
3898e+09 Emf =  38
903 Cable_Rad =  0
050000 Cable_Area =  0
0078540 Resistivity =  1
7000e-08 L =  4
0074e+07 Res =  86
741 I =  0
44850 Power =  17
448  He called up PL to tell her
KMFE: It would about 17 watts
PL: So, what, 17 watts over what mass of cable
KMFE: Oh, I hadn't thought about that
1474e+05 Mass =  2
8075e+09 Heat_Capacity =  1
0781e+12 Heating_Rate =  1
6184e-11  KMFE: Uh
it  would heat up at about 1
6e-11 Kelvin/second not counting heat lost to the environment
So
I guess imperceptible
PL: Did you calculate the equilibrium temperature
Because that's what would really matter KMFE: No, I didn't do that
PL: But it probably wouldn't be much above the ambient temperature, if it's heating so slowly
Anyway it's completely impractical
KMFE: This is true
But it does lend itself to being calculated
Which is quite a wonderful thing
PL: It is
KMFE: But it's a bad thing as well
It makes things that are simple to calculate seem more real
Which isn't true
The number might be obsolete by now
EKA answered
KMFE asked how he knew about the visitor
Before
One night he was talking and he told me the question”  KMFE suspected the meaning but tried to disguise it as a joke
Douglas Adams's question
So that's how I knew
Of course I didn't know it was that question
It was just an interesting thought
Instead of telling JPW I wrote it in my notebook
I didn't think about it except for the one time I was copying my notebook onto a computer and just thought 'oh that was interesting'
Then you showed me the Angel story, and that box, and I realized what it meant
Didn't realize right away, but I suspected
So in case I was right, I gave you the message as I left
After awhile he said goodbye to EKA and put the phone down
He paced around the room for a few more minutes
He wasn't sure if he was ready to see the visitor
He heard a door close, looked out the window and saw people leaving
After waiting a little longer he walked down the hallway to the next room
The room was empty
He couldn't see the visitor
KMFE sat down in a chair facing the bed and closed his eyes
In front of him now he could see :P sitting on the bed with her back to the wall
I don't even know if I could find it
You don't think the ultimate question was really about you meeting :P under the willow tree, do you
Isn't that what Douglas Adams was trying to say
Think about it
She was going to tell you something
That's what the key is
That's how we can find out what it's all about
The willow tree was cut down
A lot of things had changed
They knocked on the door
Someone answered and Jo gave them a convincing story, so they went upstairs to the room
KMFE sat in the same chair and faced the bed
The room actually looked almost unchanged
He closed his eyes
In his mind he saw the bed in front of him
He tried again
He sat very still
He tried to think about the things he recognized, the room, and the memories it called back
He tried to think about the dreamlike eclipse, and the visitor, and finding :P there in the room, in the space he had seen with his eyes closed
He sat there a long time
Jo stood there for a minute
You see
you had the story
That's what she was going to tell you
It's the discovery of something new
When you have a new experience, a completely new thought, and you learn something new about the world, by the time you realize, it's not new anymore
You can write about the idea, you can describe that completely, but you can't capture the newness
You can only try and fake it
That's why it's always lost, because it's so hard to hold on to
So you get back to your laptop and quickly type it up
But it's not new any more
It never seems the same when you go to record it
The missing piece of the human story
But it can't be recovered, or it wouldn't be missing in the first place
In his mind he pictured the visitor, alone with no one caring she was there
They kept putting cards down as they did not talk about the cards
Owen was writing on every piece of paper at hand
He wasn't going to save it
He was probably working on a puzzle; he would write each thought or step down as he came to it and then let them disappear together
He relied on keeping things in his mind so that the activity was not wasted
You know, Tom Healy
It's mostly a funk band but we play some more blues songs as well
He did not think in a monotone
Owen knew that Brian could bridge between worlds: there were people who Brian could interact with that seemed to think completely differently than anyone Owen could understand, yet Brian could sit here playing Oh Hell and talking about the Tom Healy Band
Owen almost wrote on the cards
He was always distracted
It annoyed him when people tried to interrupt his thoughts by talking to him
Asking questions was the worst
The worst question was "how are you
It was cruel
It became worse, not better, when the answer changed from possibly meaning something to being irrelevant: Amalie was dead and had been for some time
Owen chose bluntness as his revenge
She had been bitter and unhappy
She kept saying that it would get better, and that it wasn't permanent
But when time passed that didn't happen and she needed a way out, so that she wouldn't be wrong
She kept searching for yet another way out, a way to buy time
One time while soldering something she started to go insane, eating solder, faster and faster, unable to stop
When it killed her she had found the only remaining loophole
I was hardly part of her life: what happened to her just seemed to happen
More happened within her than could ever happen to her
It was a long time ago
I don't think about her now
I get past things and they don't matter
As far as I can tell my life is ideal for me
Owen went home that evening and picked up one of a stack of old dog-eared papers
They spanned a long time
He looked at the paper where a heart was drawn in pencil
It was pencil so it would wear away eventually
He stared at it
He was crying
Amalie, everything should be perfect
I do things that are interesting to me
I accomplish things
This whole time I've been so horribly horribly unhappy
Why can't you ever come back
The next day he did not remember any of what happened the night before
He was even more irritable and discontent than he had been yesterday but he did not know why
He just didn't like people
If he could control the world then he could trivialize them and be free
But he did not want to control anyone because to gain control he would have to interact with people, and that was intolerable
Owen walked into the shop in the determined manner he always did
He could meet challenge after challenge and they'd all be different
It seemed the whole world was designed to entertain him
The effects of so much solder on every part of his body were evident
He was a true electronics hacker, in mind and body
Several months ago Chris's dad had died of everything at once
It seemed Chris had not suffered but had merely absorbed his father's spirit: that old hacker would never really die
Chris was busily cutting and stripping and soldering and desoldering
Owen didn't understand any of it except as far as he needed to
He trusted Chris completely
that means it's too far apart
I have to ask them to redesign part of it but they're lazy and don't show up so I'm just going to do the part I can do today
Soon time disappeared and Owen's mind was inside the code again
It was an updated list of employees by floor that took his attention away
Actually, it was just one name, of someone apparently new
Second floor
Carefully picking up a worthless piece of paper - in case he shredded it - he went up the stairs to find Ellen Sherwood
Sometime his life had started seeming surreal
It had not bothered him; he denied it
Now it was particularly strong and he acknowledged that it did seem surreal
When he saw Ellen that broke apart
The idea that that name existed on that list was powerful, but seeing her was completely uncompelling
She surprised him: "I know who killed Amalie
End of the first hallway
Office labeled KMFE
The four scary letters were in front of him
Inside was a murderer
There was the key to everything that had abused him for the majority of his life
He opened the door
Inside was just a neck, no body, hanging
Owen stared and stared, because he knew he was seeing something completely completely lost
He sat down
He though he could see Amalie sitting next to him, but she was not
He was completely alone
Completely alone
He thought he could see trees in front of him, but there were not
His life was completely empty
After a long period of silence Deon asks “have you ever read anything by Machiavelli
Why do you ask
Well, was I
I hope not, but maybe some things could be interpreted that way
Though fairly harmlessly
I had made a habit of drawing on Tessa's door
This could be seen as somewhat possessive, since it meant that on the outside of her room there was always a distinctive sign of my presence
Tessa always said she really liked the drawings, but Tessa would say a lot of things
It was very very awkward when Jeff asked Tessa about the drawings
He asked her if she thought it meant anything
He asked it as if he were trying to tell her something
Later he denied that that was the case
I had been holding an interesting sense of concern to Deon and Cat
I sensed that they were going to break up soon (they didn't, except they did, then they didn't)
And I sensed that Tessa liked Deon
So I had been avoiding interfering, or doing anything more direct than drawings
Now that that year is concluded, what can I say was the overall effect of the drawings
What have I learned, and what will Tessa remember
I learned that drawings are nice but they don't communicate very much
What Tessa learned will always be a mystery to me
She's one of the most opaque people I know
I really have not the faintest idea what she was thinking at any point of freshman year
I suppose she might say the same thing about me
Why did I draw those drawings
To me it's obvious, but to Tessa it might not be
But that still leaves the question of what Deon thought
He frequently threatened (jokingly, but there is an element of truth in jokes) to erase them
Perhaps he did sense that there was something gloomy and undesirable on that whiteboard
Perhaps he was right
But I would like the summary of the whiteboard drawings to be optimistic
The positive way to summarize those drawings is this: I liked Tessa, so I drew her nice pictures
That sounds happy
And it's true, and represents a real accomplishment from a complicated and not entirely happy set of circumstances
My ultimate goal was not to draw nice drawings, but it was a memorable outcome of the process
I also invented a technique for drawing stereograms on whiteboards, and for painting with dry erase ink
I suppose I'm just trying to make what I can do make up for what I can't – talk to Tessa
I still know that everything I learned is still hollow without someone to be the recipient
Ultimately, then, Tessa's reaction does matter
And since she's still opaque, the story is inconclusive
I won't try to describe it, but it's called Hallway Goddesses
Why can't I be like that
It's not that Jeff is cheerier and happier than me - some of his other stories are quite dark
We both have the same persistent sadness that any thinking person growing up in Hopewell would
What I can't get is the optimism
I can't think about the Hallway Goddesses - those angelic people who don't even know they're special - and be entranced by them
I can't dream
It's not that I've never been obsessed with anyone
But think about who - n, :P, PL
These are not the Hallway Goddesses
These are strong, powerful people, who darn well know they're special
Maybe that's why AR never quite fit
She doesn't have the same arrogance, the same Pico de Mirandolla
And I was not used to that
But she's not a Hallway Goddess either
She's realistic like me
He explained their purpose at the first meeting
KMFE: People are not particularly enthused with communism
Brian: I hope this was not some sort of a trick for you to say everything you don't like about communism
KMFE: All economic systems are out of fashion these days
Capitalism has taken the hardest hit, but really people won't trust something new and dramatically different
KMFE: The goal is to tie the goals of this revolution to a fight against corruption
People can see the harm corruption does
KMFE: I don't really buy that communism is an economic system
It's really a way of thinking about things
It's a social concern
And honestly, when capitalism enters the debate, it too is more of a social concern than an economic system
At heart, every society is capitalist, even the most oppressively controlled
KMFE: So that brings us here, basically
And where else are you gonna find a communist revolution committed to free markets
The discussion then turned to what the specific goals of the revolution should be
KMFE made it clear that the protection of free markets was not for efficiency (in fact, he admitted he didn't really care about efficiency)
It was for peace
Free markets may be the most viable defense against war
They decided that before spending too much time figuring out the goals, they ought to put some limitations on what the revolution could and could not do
The problem with so many revolutions is that they are tainted – sometimes irreparably – by actions counter to their original goals
So it was thought necessary to lay out some strict rules:  Freedom of speech, of the press, of religion, of assembly, and all other freedoms currently granted by the US constitution will not be restricted in any way, including through legal action or intimidation
The basic function of the economy necessary to sustain life in this country will not be interrupted
No one will be killed or threatened
No action will be taken that has a good chance of causing anarchy
All actions that affect the country as a whole will be decided in a manner as democratic as possible
No revenge will be taken on parties that oppose or resist the revolution
While the goals of the revolution were still unclear, they all agreed that they had one of the best set of prohibitions
This was an encouraging start
Two weeks later an email came back from Admissions saying sorry you're not getting into Rutgers
This brings to mind a network linking professors based on the probability that they will forward an email to each other
One node can represent "problem solved"
Some professors might just ignore the mail and do nothing
Multiple professors down the chain might solve the problem
In the Barr laundry room you could meet people, because there were four washers and four dryers
Here there's one
Someone left their clothes in the dryer
A girl with brightly colored underwear
The clothes had been there at least 40 minutes, but I still felt bad about taking them out
Building policy is 5 minutes
I imagined meeting her when she finally came to get them, and wondering how irritated she might be that I had removed her clothes and set them on the dryer without folding them, and would that make our first meeting unfriendly
Well she didn't come back for at least another hour
don't tell them
They think this is Asia" Jeff told me, where "this" is Busch Campus and "they" is the local Asian population
I told him I didn't think they were fooled
And then it's too late
Didn't hear from AR today
At least the suite is clean
Hopefully it's still clean if she ever does see it
It was an expensive job because a printing company used to own the building and put immense toxic waste in the ground
Several people on the street have cancer
I went with Mark and Andrew to go look in the windows to see what was going on
It actually looked pretty empty inside
You couldn't tell much from just looking in
Then a UPS truck showed up and Mark and Andrew got scared of being caught
Now, I don't do much spying
Not really my bag
But I didn't think there was anything in particular to worry about
The guy in the UPS truck wasn't even working for whoever owned this place right now, and we weren't doing anything awful
There was a “NO TRESSPASSING” sign, but it didn't seem like a very big deal
This didn't help – they were still worried
So we ran away
Afterwards, Mark told me: “Some of the stuff we do is dangerous, but just follow what we do and you won't get in trouble
I guess Mark thought that sneaking around unused factories could actually get someone upset
My approach would have been to walk right up in broad daylight
If you look harmless and confident there's no need to be covert
Of course, Mark and Andrew really do do more illegal stuff than me
Almost all of it harmless (except perhaps having fires in their treehouse by the retention basin)
It's possible they felt older than me, and thought that more people would take them seriously
Maybe they wanted to be taken seriously
Though my other neighbor Holly shows that someone that age can get in some serious trouble
But the things Holly was up to – starting fights in malls, for instance – were more disruptive, and not in the least covert
It was a chain link fence with barbed wire on the top, which didn't slant inward so he could climb over it
DT didn't attempt to climb the fence, but ran around the building
EKA climbed over the next fence to the enclosure near the wall
Then he realized that DT could climb out the window and get into the fenced area that way
He would have to get to a safer spot before DT made it through the building
He thought he would have enough time to climb up past the window before DT got there
He climbed onto the first level, and then gripped the old falling apart windows and hauled himself up the remained two flights of stair to the roof
He was worried that DT might still be able to get here
But then DT might not think to check the roof
He saw DT run out of the building and look up
He tried to duck down low but DT saw him first
Now DT would just sit outside and wait for EKA to come down
EKA thought about running through the building, but he wasn't familiar with it and he didn't want to get trapped in the maze of hallways
Maybe if he waited until night he'd be able to get enough of a head start
But that was unlikely if he had to climb all the way down
Then he thought about jumping and landing on DT
He'd never tried anything like that before and he didn't know if it was practical
It would probably be easy for DT to dodge
Might there be some place to hide inside
How long would it take DT to get up to the second floor
EKA wished he knew what this building was used for
Then again, the windows might not open, which would explain why DT hadn't attempted to follow EKA onto the roof
He decided to risk it
He climbed down to the second story window, which apparently opened up and out
He climbed down further to open it, then crawled into the building
AR laughed a horrified laughter
I told her it was for expos
That means that the professor knows you
I wonder if she'll know that it's me who wrote it
She gave a few false starts and asked "What did you write
And I wrote that I do miss you, because when she reads it you will be far away
But even after writing all those papers I still couldn't say what I really liked about you, or how I really felt
So I left that out
For example why does it bother me on some level that AR is happy for the semester to end
What does that have to do with me
Or, rather, how is it any of my business
If I told you that I don't know what day it is, what would that mean to you
It would mean you didn't have a good memory for days
Like me
I never know what day it is
So
I wouldn't have a good memory for days
What would that tell you about me
That
you just don't care enough to remember
Or you don't have a good memory
OK what else
Um
that's all I can think of
Geez
OK, so say it happened a lot of different times, on different days, in different places
You don't think that would tell you anything else about me
I honestly wouldn't think it would be such a big deal
Some people just don't have a good sense of time
But shouldn't there be a REASON I don't have a good sense of time
Um
no
Maybe you just don't
Aw man
You're no fun
OK, think about it this way
I don't know what day it is because it's not important enough for me to remember
I mean, even if I were bad at remembering, if I needed to, I could come up with a way to know
Since I didn't, it must not be important to me
No I think you might just not have the initiative
Geez
OK, let's just assume that if I really wanted to remember I could
And since I don't, I don't want to
Now, what kind of person doesn't need to know what day it is
Someone
who does the same thing every day
OK that would be possibility
So clearly not someone who needs to go to class every day, right
OK so not a college student
OR, maybe they are a college student
Say you know I'm a college student
Obviously, since I don't need to go to class, I either totally don't care about school, or I'm just that good that I can skip class and still get an A
But clearly not in the middle
It's either one of those extremes
All right
So isn't that interesting
That little piece of information puts this person definitely at some extreme, but you don't know which one
Yeah, I guess
I don't know
You're making fun of me aren't you
No, not making fun of you
Just exploring your style of thinking
I had no idea where that was going to go
I started off with "I don't know what day it is" and just let it go from there
Wait, you seriously had no idea where that was going to end up
You just picked some random detail and went with it
Pretty much
I really didn't even know if it was going to go somewhere
Awesome
I thought of playing this scene the way it ought to go, where I don't believe what I see, close my eyes, pause thirty seconds to collect my thoughts, then open my eyes again with an expression of wonder on my face
I think had I just acted naturally here I would have kept my eyes open, smirked in a "haha world you're trying to screw with me but I'm too far gone for that" sort of way, then looked around and pretended to know what's going on
But I tried to meld these two behaviors, so I closed my eyes in a "that's what I should be doing, right
me: Damn
I know this place
EE: You know it from where
me: I mean I've been here
A
lot
This is home
And it doesn't exist anymore
EE: This is where you used to live
No
I do know this place
I've been here
maybe once
I looked around and felt a little uncomfortable at how familiar all this was
Because this place really doesn't exist in my world anymore
I mean it does exist, but
not like this
Not with everything
mine
Where it's my place, and I don't have to worry about what's changing
I noticed a few key memories, some good hoop positions, paths that led places, windows that I knew what room they were for
me: Now, man, I think I really have to get out of here
This isn't right
We walked down the driveway
It was all the same the whole way
We got to the road and turned left
We didn't talk
We got to the tracks and started walking down them to the right
At some point we had to stop and figure out what we were doing
me: I've started to realize that I don't really know who I am
I have
multiple lives in multiple places
Alternating and overlapping
Many disconnected stories
And some of those stories have
ended
There are parts of my life that I still remember clearly, maybe I'll forget some day and they'll die entirely, but they're already dead on the outside, because I can no longer receive external confirmation that that world is real
So I don't know
who I am, really
EE: I feel
I think probably everyone has that
People's lives change
me: I
yeah, that's true
It doesn't make it less
real, though
This is just
gone
Just a whole part of my life eliminated
A lot of things I'd learned or gotten used to now serve no purpose
I have all this useless knowledge sitting around, and memories I don't dare give up
Because all that exists are the memories
I can destroy a world by forgetting
We walked back along the tracks, up the road to the driveway
Halfway up the driveway we stopped again
me: But
why are you here
You're not part of this world
for me
You
are an extinct world too, but a different one
EE: This isn't all just your memory here
This place, this is a dead world for me too
And you're part of that world, I know that for sure
me: So
this is your memory we're in
EE: This is your memory of my memory
The guy pointed a gun at him and made him empty his pockets, which contained a wallet and cell phone
He threw the cell phone down the sewer then started going through the wallet
He held up KMFE's ATM card
Mugger: What's the pin for this
KMFE: 8752 Mugger: You better not be lying to me
If you're lying you gonna die
KMFE: I'm not lying
Mugger: Why 8752
KMFE: 1987 is when the first Einstein Ring was discovered [1]
The rest is a Fibonacci sequence
Mugger: Fibonacci sequence
that's where each number is the sum of the two before it
KMFE: That's right
Mugger: So 8752 how is that a Fibonacci sequence
8 + 7 is 5
KMFE: Well it's modular arithmetic
8 + 7 is 15, is 5 more than a multiple of 10
Mugger: Yeah OK I see you just take the last digit
KMFE: That's right
Mugger: So then 7 + 5 is 2
Then 7, 9, 6
Does it go on forever
KMFE: Well after 60 digits it'll repeat
Mugger: Now supposing I start with 5,1
KMFE: Well you see if you follow the first one some more, 7, 9, 6, 5, 1, you get to 5,1
So it's part of the same cycle
But if you started with something not in that cycle, say 0,5, you get something different
Mugger: Ah I see
Then he left
When KMFE got to work he told Brian KMFE: Well, today has been mixed so far
On the downside I got mugged, and on the upside I got to explain Fibonacci sequences to someone who actually cared
Brian: What, the mugger
KMFE: Yep
Brian: Wait, seriously
He wasn't just faking you out
KMFE: He seemed genuinely interested
Brian: If he can do math what's he going around mugging people for
KMFE: Brian, you can do math
How do you rate this job as compared to a life of crime
Brian: Look, I know we joke about it, but it's not like this job is really worse than robbing people on the street
KMFE: Well, I mean, I guess it's all a matter of preference

About 1Am
About 2, maybe three awake
It's like, I thought for a time that ll actually wanted to be unhappy
Why would you think that
Just looking at what happened
Ll always seemed to be in some sad situation
I didn't know how deliberate ll was, but it seemed like quite a pattern
Which would have meant ll liked to be sad
Couldn't they be sad without wanting to
Yeah
But I wouldn't expect someone to accidentily seek it out
But I had another theory
I thought that maybe it wasn't true sadness
Some people act sad as another method of communication
But ll didn't act sad
Ll simply was, and occasionally would agree with this, but mostly just was
So you don't know anything
No, not really
Dark, some unspecific time in the late evening to night, same day
None of the same people are present
A long bridge crosses the river
The railing is between three and five feet hight, plastic, new looking
N1 is about 1/3 across the bridge
A long thought does not snap as it stretches from the near shore
N2 might be thinking something too but it does not matter
N3 began to realize something
That did not matter yet
EKA might have looked at N4 and said That is KMFE, and it would have fit
N4 was KMFE because they did not exist, and they almost could not exist, but EKA would always think they did
N4 was not KMFE because N4 was looking down not up
Do you intend to do something
What would I intend to do
Why do you ask that
Look, is that light a boat, or is it on land
That's the highway
No, I really do ask if you intend to do something
To the right of the highway
Well obviously I intend to do something
Not necessarily
No, I suppose not
But either I intend to do something or I do do something
Or both
I think there are some things that you might intend that someone might prevent
Which would those be
I don't know
That's why I ask
Give me
No
The long thought almost broke
N4 thought that N4 was KMFE
KMFE was not there
Luckily EKA had no say in this
STOP THAT
It was never clear which of N1&2 pushed who off the bridge, neither survived
Back in the dark room, Do you even need to know anything
No, I suppose not
I doubt there is anything to know
So the thing is KMFE had trouble doing things on the spur of the moment
Leads to a lot of wasted opportunities
So he was trying to train himself to have a little initiative
So there's this piano in the classroom (big classroom, class of 400) where he has economics
The professor like jazz and usually puts jazz on the speakers before class
So KMFE figured one day he should play jazz on the piano before the professor set up his laptop and started playing music
It was also early in the morning (by KMFE standards) because he had economics early
And on top of that he has been up for the past 15ish hours working on a presentation for Materials Processing
These past few weeks he hadn't really slept at night
He slept mostly in the morning and in the evening, or at random times
So there wasn't a clear distinction between days
He got annoyed when people asked him "how late were you up last night
It just doesn't work that way
So he ate breakfast (which is only really breakfast by dining hall schedule, and not his), and got on the bus
Which is unpleasant because he's tired and the bus shakes and rocks around a lot
And goes around some tight curves and he's standing up and visualizing in his mind the shear force and bending moment in his body inflicted by the centrifugal force and the supports at his hands and feet
And then he's in Scott Hall, and he sits down, but then decides that if he sits down much longer he's just going to stay there because it's so much easier than actually walking up to the piano
So he maneuvers out of the seats, walks up on to the stage (ignoring the steps), and presses one key on the piano
It's so loud
This is going to be hard to do discretely
Why should he do it discretely
He's not really sure
It's not like it's quiet in here with a couple hundred people talking
He won't be disturbing anyone
But they'll notice him
And that's bad enough
He sits down and presses his foot on the quiet peddle, hoping it will be less noticeable
It sounds just as loud when he starts playing
He starts with Footprints, because he knows it and he won't mess up even under pressure, then goes into My Funny Valentine, then just improvises for a few minutes
He keeps his watch in front of him so he doesn't run into the professor's music interval
At ten minutes before class starts he gets up
He thinks he hears someone yell "Aw keep playing" but he pretends not to hear
As he walks off the stage the people in the first few rows clap
The professor didn't even notice
Oh well
This class is just going to be review, on account of it being the last one
And it's really noisy
People won't stop talking
Then go outside where he has to wait a long time for a bus
Not because the buses don't show up, but because the number of people waiting will not physically fit on one bus
Even when they pack in real tight, and the last few people have to push on really hard, and the very last people are hanging out the door and realize that they can't push hard enough so they get off and wait for the next one
And when he does get on a bus it's really packed, and hot and steamy and everyone is squashed together
Then to expos to write the final essay
First sit around for a while not talking to AR, or maybe talking to AR but more likely not
Then writing the essay and falling into the same trap he always falls in (as has been his tradition since 11th grade) of writing too much for the allotted time and rushing the conclusion to the point of illegibility
And asking the professor how much time is left when he's on his second paragraph and she says 5 minutes
Then finally being done, talking to the professor a few minutes and straightening out some of the desks, then leaving for a bus to go to Busch and give a presentation for Materials Processing
The professor obviously disapproves of KMFE's 36 slides (which he has to pack into 5 minutes), but what the professor doesn't know is that KMFE is really bad at powerpoint so instead of making things change within a slide he just does a lot of successive slides with little changes between each one
So it's actually a really brief presentation
Now KMFE thought that after playing piano in front of 200 people and writing a timed essay he would have enough adrenaline produced to do a presentation without looking nervous, but this is not the case
Oh well, better luck next time
And then what
That's it for classes
Time to study sol-gel processing
Or maybe go to the practice rooms
And in two days got to Meeting and maybe Charlie or Jeff will go too
But probably not going to see AR much
THE CAGE  The ground was very wide and long
It was tall and deep
0xE1 walked on the vast ground, noticing it under his feet, and noticing the air composing the weaher that was all around him
The cage blocked his wandering path
It was such a big  cage
So much taller than anything 0xE1 had ever seen before
It was almost _too _big, but it was more amazing than intimidating
It was almost a miracle
The occupants were unfamiliar to 0xE1
It was not suprising, as the cage itself was another world
0xE1 walked into the cage
0x72 and 0x4A were standing at the very edge and looking out
They noticed 0xE1
0x72 [to 0x4A]: 20 cents
Give it here
0x4A: Ok next one's gonna walk by 0x72: you watch out you're down 2
40 now  0x55: 20 _bucks the next 5 walk right in here 0x4A: that's it i'm out after one more  0xE1: Watchya betting on
0x4A: go away you lost me 20c 0xE1 [to 0x72]: Watchya betting on
0x80: They're guessing whether people walk in here or pass by 0xE1: and do they walk in here or pass by
0x80: Pass by, mostly  There were more people in the cage than 0xE1 had first noticed
It actually seemed rather crowded despite it being such a big cage
0x24 [to 0x79]: It's an odd attitude for captivity, really
I just don't understand some people
0x79: Some people are not meant to be understood
The sun had been rising for too long and it was bothering 0x64  0x64: That isn't rising, dammit
0x80: Oh it is so, look: half covered by the horizon: rising 0x64: But, it's been like that for like, 5 hours
And I don't think, at least, to the farthest of my great understanding, that that even counts as rising
0x24: Well I think some people _are meant to be understood, or at least they benefit greatly from it
0x79: I doubt you will discover that to be true
Well, I really don't know
But I have never known anyone to benefit from comprehension
0x24: Well how do you know that
0x79: What do you mean how do I know that
The next person walked by  0x4A: Alright
down 2
20 and imoutahere
0x72 [to person walking by]: HEY GET IN HERE
OVER HERE
YOU
The person waved and kept walking
0x49 strolled out of the cage and quickly dissappeared over the hill
0x24: Do you not have to understand someone to know if it has not benefited them
0x79: No, I do not
The sun was still rising
0x24 leaned against the bars and looked directly at it
0x24 [to himself]: They tell you not to look directly at the sun
0x24: at least I can be disobedient
It might be good practice
A frisbee hit 0x24 on the arm
He turned around
0xE1: Sometimes I think that everything in the world really is inside this cage and that we imagine everything we think we see out there
0x24: If we imagine it how do we see things out there that nothing in here could tell us
0xE1: It's not that different, really, there's just more of it
Look
We got grass in here and grass out there
We got the air, we got up and down just the same
0x64: We haven't got a sky
Or a sun
0xE1: That's ture
We haven't got a sun or stars or moon, or clouds
I wonder why they have them out there
0x55: Not telling
0x38: Freedom
They got that out there
0x24: But what do you really _mean by freedom
0x38: You know, liberty, freedom,  0xE1: what do you mean, not telling
0x80: Exactly what she said
0xE1: You mean you know
0x55: maayybe
0xE1: Some people's entire lives seem an invention
0x80: But how do you even know what that is if we don't have it in here
0x38: I know I want to walk about without bars to confine me
I don't want to feel the cold enclosure of the cage on me
0x24: What, so freedom is unconstrained location
The wind blew and 0xE1 was cold
0x72: Man if you're that cold in this wind what do you do in a storm
Someone chucked the firsbee again and 0xE1 chased after it, until it soared between the bars and out of sight
0x72 [to 0xE1]: Sometimes I wonder what you would do if this cage just lifted up and left you exposed to a whole fierce world
0xE1: I always thought I might try to die free and happy
0x72: You're hopeless  0x79 [to 0x72]: _You_ are hopeless
Without hope
No hope for you
Can't have any
Go away
0xE1: I think I'd ask you to kill yourself, but I suppose I don't actually want you dead
0x79: Are you sure
0xE1: Quite sure, but not really
Well, I'm not an entirely good person
0x79: You're not, are you
0xE1: and your death could be practical 0x79:
0xE1: it could get me out of this cage
God I hate this cage
The weather was cooling
0x24 looked across the small enclosure and was not happy
He felt deliberately trapped
0x24: I suspect our whole captivity might be just one long chain hanging donwn from some powferful person
0x38: Does this grass look greener than that grass
0x24: Is that a metaphor
0x38: no I really mean that: there is a green patch in this corner
0xD3: It was probably there last year but it's been spreading
0x24: But I think there could be some hope
0xD3: From what
0x38: He said that this cage is all 0x80's fault
0x24: Not necessarily - wait, i didn't mention her - I don't think - I didn't mean it was all anyone's fault it's just that something less than freedom is here  0xD3: There's always something less than freedom
0x80: What are you talking about
0x24: Do you think this patch of grass is greener 0x80: Yeah, it probably just grew from last year
0x24: It really doesn't make sense if there's a whole big world out there that everyone is just in this little cage
0xD3: Inefficient
0x24: Unnatural
0x80: I'm unnatural
0x24: Other things are too
Meanwhile 0x2C had walked into the cage behind them
They wouldn't notice until they were overjoyed to discover she had another frisbee
0x72: Over here
0x38: I think I can know what freedom is even if I've never had it 0x24: then tell me: what is difference between life with freedom and life without freedom
The frisbee flew over 0x38, then over 0x72 who leaped to catch it; it landed on the ground
Several people ran to pick it up
A struggle ensued
0x80: Look at them
They're so immature
0x24: I wonder if we have a kick ball
0x38: Are you saying you want to play 'never never kick ball' now
0x24: No, I was just wondering
It's a game where you kick a ball at people to get them out, then someone else steals the ball, and if the person who got you gets gotten you're free
0xE1: Toss it here
0x72: Farther back
0x38: And you never kick the ball
0x24: I don't know why it's called that
Anyway, it's a nice analogy
0x24: I wanna steal the ball
0x24: But really, I'm already out
So somebody else has got to do it
And i'm gonna tell them to
0x38: Whose got the ball now
0x24: I don't actually know
0x72: How about throw it _to_ me
0x38: Well when we're free remember to wake me up and tell me
0x24: Got it
0x38: Good night
0xE1: You ran the wrong way
It was 11:23
0x24 threw the digital clock down on it's face
0x24: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUGHHHHHHH
0x38:
0x24: Everytime I look at that clock I try and see if the digits form a fibonacci sequence and that time they _did_ but there was no meaning to it and it was just pointless but I was still thinking about it
0x38: Why a fibonacci sequence
0x24: No reason
Well, no good reason
It's the top of a long chain
0x38: What is the top of a chain
0x24: Ok, end of a chain
But not really
A step in a long progression
From an egg to a wall to the blades of grass to the catastrophe to now I'm staring at a damn digital clock looking for a damn fibonacci sequence
0x78: You have weird obsessions
0x38: Well, I'm not sure that it's an obsession because it's hard to tell what he's obsessed with
I mean I don't think it's actually fibonacci sequences
0x24: People who pretend to be scary
0x78: Are you saying I pretend to be scary
0x24: No
It's actually an interpretation of something someone said
0x78: Who
0x24: Someone described someone else as pretending not to be scary, but in reality being truly terrifying
But it occurred to me that scariness is not really a quality so much as an appearance: you are scary if you scare people
So I flipped it around: people pretend to be scary
0x78: Who was this
0x24: You always want a name
Why does it matter
How about just a number: it means the same thing
Pick any base you want
0x80: Hexadecimal
0x78: Everything I do annoys you
I happen to like to know who someone is talking about
0x24: You're like the HUAC: always trying to get me to name names
Well no more
0xE1: _You're_ just trying to turn this pathetic little situation into a matter of principle so you can pretend it's meaningful
There's a whole world out there and you don't wan to beleive it
0x38: You think you can solve something by looking at the whole world
But you know perfectly well that you're not going to _do_ anything on that scale
You're paralyzed by the size of the object you want to achieve 0x24: You know I think if you have convinced me of anything it is that if I have a good idea I shouldn't discuss it with you
0x79: How would you know you haven't had any ideas
0x48: Trying to find fault in the motivations of change is not going to help
We must act in the moment that we have
We should confront the world as we meet it
Only a practical approach will save us
0xE1: But by that very logic it is imperitive to look for a decent if not successful plan
People can act with intent, and it is not beyond consideration to guide that intent towards the goal, rather than walk aimlessly
0x79: You place too much trust in people
A plan is an illusion, the following of a plan an invented goal
There are real forces in the world that can be moved to achieve equally real change
0x24: When you talk about forces you create an illusion
You polarize the world into specific channels and you can't see what's really going on
It's a pit of unreality
0xA1: Why do you even think that there is a goal
What is so special about change that makes it better than constancy
0xF3: I don't need to explain the disaster the world is now to need to change it
0x49: Just by saying that you're assuming something about what is good and bad
0xF3: That's ok with me
0xE1: Yet somehow we're still stuck in this bloody cage and we have no idea what's going on
0x49: Stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage
0x24: It's 'cell', 'nor iron bars a cell'
0x49: Cage works too
0xE1: It doesn't make any difference
You're not saying it because it means anything, You're saying it because you're stuck in this cage and you know you're not getting out
0x49: You don't get it
I'm telling you that this cage isn't real
It's an illusion
0xE1: I guess it's like 0xF3 said: I'll assume it and I don't care if I can't know for sure
that's tricky
YES YOU ARE SUMMER
You gave her your own horns, for god's sake
And her story is a lot like the kind of things you imagined for yourself
Sure, it's not entirely autobiographical, but Summer clearly represents you
So why are you trying to be so subtle and nuanced about it
Why not just admit what is obvious
Do you want to make it look like it's a big, tricky, mystery
That you had some secrets worth hiding
Let's cut through all that
You are summer
Good
Now that's done with
Next question
I guess I've given you some harsh criticism lately
Particularly with regards to n
And how you told me what to think, and made me lose my old dreams
That's what I was thinking as I ran away
But even as I ran, I couldn't forsake you entirely
You had turned me into who I am now
You made me grow up
You are almost more a part of me than is my former self
And certainly more than n will ever be
And so I looked back, and I became a pillar of salt
From 'The Cage': > 0xE1: I think I'd ask you to kill yourself, but I suppose I don't actually want you dead
Well, I'm not an entirely good person
God I hate this cage
I stepped lightly off the curb onto the asphalt
It was beginning to warm, but the wind still felt cool
There's too much light in the city, and you can't see the stars within miles of it
An empty parking lot at night
Don't forget about the ghosts," I reminded him
Pale yellow light shone down on his hair, glistening at me
I kept to the shadow
As I watched, the figure turned his head up, toward the bright signs, as if he guessed I had just been there
I knew that he wasn't really watching anything
David proved his aim again with a can he picked off the ground
He ran up to the wall as if to jump it, then pushed off it with his hands and ran backwards
I tossed him another can
He wasn't watching me
About a minute passed and then David startled
I assumed this was turning to shock but I was only watching the lone person on the opposite sidewalk
It would naturally bother him that I had a gun in my hand
I don't think there was any way it wouldn't have shocked him, but it was ok for me because he couldn't even speak now
Meanwhile that lonely figure was still in peace
I watched him carefully to summarize who he was
A complete answer was absent, but stray thoughts collected
You lived alone in spirit, Jon, I thought to myself
I think maybe you wanted something more for yourself that you never got
You were mistreated all through life and there is no hope of peace on your horizon
Jon's eyes still stared forward with no expression
Maybe there was a hint of fear
I couldn't tell
You were never able to defend yourself, and now you won't have to
I just hope it ends here
May your soul at last find peace
The sound of the gun was an insult to the calm evening
I don't remember if David screamed, but I saw out of the corner of my eye he was lying against the wall shivering
I looked out at the fallen body, imagining his tortured soul trying and failing to find peace in heaven, living the afterlife in the same state of horror that befriended him before death
I tossed the weapon in the dumpster and walked slowly out of the parking lot
He did this because he lived through the metaphor
He anticipated people reading the story
He wanted to write the story for their desires
Turns out he was wrong
First they messed up the story
Then they argued over it
It was lost on their ears
When KMFE asked God for the meaning of creation, it was so apparent that KMFE knew nothing of the music that for frustration and embarrassment God could not answer him
Thus has been God since then
KMFE stood on a mountain top and asked his question and received no answer, because God could not face him
And it was with this memory that KMFE met EKA
EKA was introduced to KMFE by dead philosophers
They are weak, the new friend said, but I am strong
He can see the fallacy in the ontological argument, but he can't see the flaw
The argument is invalid because it assumes that the sofa that exists can be distinguished from the identical sofa that does not, but the argument is simply WRONG because it reduces the sofa to something you can't even sit in
The long wood and metal walkway was underneath you
Further underneath, and stretching far to the right was the sea
The view above was covered by the sky, thick and opaque
Above that lay a sea more vast than any you had ever seen
You believed the path that carries you forward
You trusted the walls and held away from the sea
Somehow you might find a trust in that sea; it is your friend
With time it had become like yourself
But no one really saw that because no one noticed either
You now, at this one unimportant moment, were walking towards the transportation hub, known by its common title, the ^Hub
From there you would have access to the rest of human civilization
You had never seen the rest of human civilization; most of it never had and never would
The sea is vast, and people are numerous; civilization is a very big thing
The weather was cold, cloudy, misty, as it ought to be for today
You felt you would rather be in a distant and unfamiliar place
You were in no such place, and so you moved your mind away from your body, carried by the weather
We hauled the snow together into a messy stack
I gouged out three cavities to make eyes and a mouth
Then I stepped sideways to a door, turned the knob, took out some white rope, and tossed it to David
We pushed stakes into the ground and wound the rope around them, tying it into a loop
The rope made the pattern of a five-pointed star around the snowman
I waved to a face staring out of a window in the chocolate factory
More faces accumulated at the windows
Orange gloves threw a stick over the fence and I pointed at it when it landed
David picked it up and threw it at the snowman, knocking off a piece of snow
I picked it up and threw it again
We repeated this over and over again until the snowman was obliterated
A truck drove by with a picture of the dead snowman on the side
A dark cloud came overhead and Orange gloves went inside as snow began to hit my head
The snow pushed me around and it was heavy
David and I ran inside as the sky turned black and it became night
Looking out the window at the chocolate factory I saw there were new people there, with torches lit on poles and laughing and talking
They were there all night
In the morning the house was surrounded by snowmen
I felt sick and didn't want to go outside
It was still snowing
She lived on my floor
Can you give a message to her
yeah
I don't know when I'll see her, though
Can you tell her I love her, and I enjoyed knowing her
And that I'm sorry I screwed up her life
And that I'd like to see her some time
She didn't believe me because she didn't know him
Then I showed it to her and she thought I had written it there to fool her
I got upset that she didn't believe me and she got upset that I was lying to her
We left mad at each other
I kept looking through the test to figure out if there was anything there that would have prompted him to write AR's name on the top
Nothing
Just her name, still there
KMFE: I want to know about ll way more than n
Jo: You want to know about other people, not you or her
That's why you don't want to be specific
She asked if you'd like to clarify, but you're not going to do that, are you
KMFE: I'll have to give it awhile
Maybe I should give an example
About ll
But that would sound like I'm accusing her
Jo: She's not your spy, however much it may have seemed that way once
KMFE: How am I going to complete the stories if I don't know
the stories
It's like taking statistics from a biased sample
If you don't know how it's biased you can't get a good result
Jo: That's really how life is, isn't it
You never get an unbiased story
Ever
There will always be mysteries
KMFE: I am a curious person
Jo: That is becoming increasingly obvious KMFE: A long time ago I came up with a trick to aggravate my curiosity
I would avoid finding out what the color puce looks like
It worked well because it's a little detail I could have looked up any time I wanted
MC liked that idea
Other people tortured me about it
Jo: Did you eventually give up
KMFE: No
But honestly I lost interest
It's enough work for me not to figure it out based on context
But the story about n, that bothers me
And with that one I don't have a choice
Nobody knows the answer
The answer doesn't exist
Jo: Did you ever ask PL the answer
KMFE: I might have
I don't remember
Did I ever tell her what n means
I've honestly forgotten so much
Jo: She might know
KMFE: I don't want her story
Jo: You should, though
She'd want yours
KMFE: No she wouldn't
She doesn't like my story
Jo: It looked like she did in that last email
KMFE: I don't know what the deal with that was
It was late
And she avoided the question
Jo: She didn't understand the question
You hid the question on purpose
KMFE: She tried to make it about her
Jo: As well she should have
And it should have been about her
KMFE: That email did actually make me feel a little better
Jo: I don't think the scary story is true
KMFE: It is, though
Maybe not with the real n, who I don't even know
It's true somehow
Or I'm scared of change
Jo: Well, I don't mean to criticize your whole way of thinking
Just have some faith in what PL told you
I think she meant it way more honestly than you will ever admit
KMFE thought about what Jo had said, decided that PL probably did mean something honest by her answer, and then reread the email
That cast some doubt on the conclusion
KMFE: Now it appears that she was being somewhat combative
KMFE: She was trying to convince me that what I was asking about, what I thought mattered, was in fact of little consequence compared to everything else
Jo: Frankly, I think she is right, even though I do not follow her advice
Stories make little things seem bigger, and that is a virtue and an insight, but it does not mean the issues themselves have assumed more consequence
KMFE: But can't she pretend, as in my stories
KMFE: Actually, no, she won't
Because pretending is far too friendly
It's one of the friendliest things you can do, really
And she won't do that for me
KMFE's story  The Boltzman Brain Hypothesis suggests that we are, as complex life, alone in the universe
This is the one planet, among the forest of galaxies, who tried that experiment that we call life
And that means that this is the one planet where it's possible for something to matter
Without evolution to create beings with a goal, things just are
Only on this planet can things be good, or bad
Only on this planet can you have goals
A goal is a very tricky thing, if you think about it
It's just a piece of information, yet one that plays out in the tangible environment
And it's one that matters
You know, we're THAT PLANET
Wrapped up in our own little way of seeing things, that none of the rest of the universe can appreciate
Seeing in feeling in ways that none of our billions of neighbors will understand or care about
I guess I should sympathize with that
Then I found out that earth is not alone
She found other planets who can feel and care
I guess that sort of made me a little jealous
KMFE: Oh
Damn
I thought it was kind of public since she told her entire bio class
Steve: Yeah that's what I thought too but apparently she doesn't like Jeff knowing
KMFE called Jeff to ask for AU's email so he could apologize to her
Jeff: Stalker
KMFE: I just want to tell her something
I'm not going to bother her
Jeff: Yeah I know
promisedsunset@gmail
com
AU told KMFE not to worry about it
She said she had overreacted
She didn't say anything more and Jeff didn't have any comment on the situation either
EKA: Well at least the phrase "promised susnset" should make you think of something
KMFE: It's amazing how fast I don't need to think about that
KMFE sat in the bridge of Lucy Stone Hall where you can look out the large windows
Two people were on the other side of the hall discussing moral systems
And such
During switching time you can see masses of people walking by the building
That was the last thing he remembered before falling asleep
He woke up in darkness
It was nighttime, but still there should be streetlights -- the campus is so bright you can't see stars
Someone had hung curtains over the windows
KMFE drew the curtains back slightly
The light was enough for him to see the philosophy students asleep in the chairs on the other side of the hall
They showed no signs of waking
Figuring it would be better to let them sleep in peace he opened the stairwell door as quietly as possible and walked out of the building
KMFE walked back to Busch and discovered it was 2:30 AM
He still had no explanation for what had happened, other than to suppose that maybe they always put curtains on those windows overnight
PEE lecture was moved and it took him most of the class period to find it
When he did find it he didn't want to walk in so late so he just went to the dining hall and ate breakfast
He saw AR there but she was sitting with the guy he guessed to be her boyfriend so he didn't go say hi to her
Walking out he met Samiha and walked with her back to the suites where she was going to meet Aditya
The sky was dark and it looked like it would rain soon
KMFE sat agains the side of the building and watched the sky
He needed to remember to get his bike from Tillet
Good thing it's under a roof
Too bad it's raining so he can't study outside
EKA: You never study outside anyway
KMFE: But it would be nice to try it
Those people always look so content
EKA: It's an act
The whole place could be a mess
Jo forced open the door and walked in
TDCP waited about a minute and then followed her
Inside there were indeed signs of construction, with some plywood on a table and sawdust everywhere
GL can't annoy you that much
One of them introduced herself to me
I think her name might have been Jasmine
I'm too nervous to call her that, though, and have it not be her
I like knowing people
I don't use the floor lounge so much this year
I used it a few nights
The people from the suite one space left and across the hall use it frequently for studying
I don't talk to them except to say hi
They're nice (so it seems -- I have no interaction with them)
There's one who seems to stay there all night way too often
Reminds me of me last year (except she doesn't look like she's having fun
She's killing herself to get through college)
They don't vote
They barely remembered who was running
This I overheard
I eavesdrop too much, but anyway, I still remember it so I might as well recall what I heard
Jasmine (I think) smiled at me passing in the stairs and I smiled back but wasn't sure enough it was her to say hi
She's a senior majoring in something
She told me
I forget
I should go out there again some time
He was impossible to keep track of anymore, and since he never made any effort to contact her, AR felt hurt
Not enough not to worry, but enough not to talk about it
But Jo was concerned, because KMFE had left behind the notebook
TDCP confirmed Jo's suspicion that KMFE would never leave his notebook behind
TDCP: I can show you why I remember this clearly
He flipped to a particular page
TDCP: It's this line here
The line read “People who preach on the street corner are going to hell
He wrote it down
You see this thing has his whole life in it
Jo: Or yours
TDCP: Probably many people
I bet there's no small number who would love to decode this stuff
Jo: There's something else in the notebook that worried me, though
TDCP: Show it to me
Jo: Well, there's a lot of math in here
Number theory, mostly
Look at this line
You don't think he was cracking codes
TDCP looked skeptical
TDCP: Well, no, I don't, to be honest
I have my own theories about what that math is about
But that's not important
But I can tell you why I think he disappeared
Jo: I was hoping he might have told you
TDCP: No, he didn't
He doesn't tell anyone where he goes
So to start off, I'm not exactly worried
But here's what I think he's up to
He's smart, dreamy, ambitious and bored
OK, you probably know a lot of people like that
But he also got a chance to work with the Korose
TDCP: Now we know that didn't go so well
But it proved to him he could do something and be useful somewhere
TDCP: So I'm guessing when the Revolution started, he said to himself, “I can do that”
And then he left to do it
Jo: Do what
TDCP: I don't know, honestly
But it's not hard to imagine it requiring him to leave
He may not even have intended to leave in secrecy
He just doesn't think about other people when he runs off
TDCP: I honestly think that's pretty obviously what he's up to
What else is he going to do with himself
Jo: Well, after the Korose episode, something makes me wonder if he could ever survive the boredom of being stuck on earth
Jo: You remember how much that radio meant to him
He would only leave Korose if he could get away with that
But now that that's over
I wonder
TDCP: Well, I mean I'd like to leave earth too if I had the chance
But I don't, and most people don't either, not even KMFE
TDCP: And if I were you I'd hide that notebook real good
It was dark when a phone call brought him back to reality
The first real sound he'd heard all day
He picked the buzzing phone off his desk (which amplified it) and answered
It was Penelope, telling him that if he didn't get off his computer and come see her before ten o'clock she'd spend the night with Chris in Mattia
Penelope was a senior at East Brunswick High School
She had come to visit for the weekend, but Ulysses had been busy most of the time
Today it was Saturday, Penelope was leaving tomorrow morning, and Ulysses had spent all day on webreg
She told him she was in Chris's room now
Ulysses would have to come find her
Ulysses shut the phone  and looked out the window at Mattia
From his room he could see the whole building with the windows lit up
His own room, on the fourth floor in Barr, was dark
Chris's room was on the first floor of Mattia, Ulysses wasn't sure which window
With a sigh, as his schedule was still a mess, Ulysses shut the laptop, put on his coat and sandals, and left the room
A bunch of people were studying in the lounge
Or maybe they were playing Pandemic 2, but they weren't playing poker right now
Ulysses sat down heavily on a couch next to Matt
Matt: Hey, what's up
Ulysses: Webreg Matt: Oh yeah
I hear you
Still working on your schedule
Ulysses: Yeah, nothing fits
I still need to register for chem, and decide if I want to take a humanities elective this semester
I had to stop because Penelope's upset
Matt: Oh is she visiting you this weekend
That sucks if someone visits you and you're busy all the time
I know how it is
But you'll have weekends when you're not so busy and she can visit
She's not like really pissed is she
Ulysses: I'm just worried because she threatened to spend the night in Chris's room
She just called me and I'm going over there now
I'm worried she's going to be like made at me and not friendly
Matt: Oh, yeah
Why don't you like bring her something
Do you have any like candy stashed in your room
Or like flowers
I guess you don't have time to go buy something
Ulysses: No, I mean, yeah, I really ought to bring her something
I have an hour
I suck and buying gifts, though
You don't think they have flowers in the convenience store, do you
Matt: I doubt it, bro
They don't have that much stuff in the convenience store
Why don't you make her a card
You know, say you're sorry you're busy, and decorate it all pretty
Ulysses: Might as well give it a shot
All right see you man
Ulysses got up to leave
Morgan the RA noticed him walking out of the lounge and said  Morgan: Hey whoa aren't you gonna stay for the floor meeting
We're starting in like twenty minutes
Ulysses: Oh, man I forgot about that
Hey, I'm sorry about this, but Penelope's mad pissed that I haven't been spending time with her, and I'm going to see her now
I don't want to run out on your floor meeting, you know, I just kind of have to do this right now
Morgan: All right, just make sure you talk to someone and find out what you missed
We're going to be talking about community standards
Ulysses: All right man I'll do that
Sorry about it
There were people assembled for the floor meeting, and Ulysses' lament got a reaction of sympathy from some of them
Aditi offered to go talk to Penelope
Aditi: She's got to understand that when you're in college, you can't do that
I mean, you're an engineering student
You can't just run off whenever she wants you to
You've got work and stuff
She should just chill out
Ulysses: Thanks Aditi, but, no offense, but you'd probably make her angrier
Aditi: All right well if you ever want me to talk some sense into her, you just ask
Aditi will be happy to do it
All right babe good luck
Ulysses wandered back to his room and got out a sheet of paper
He folded it hamburger-style and got out some sharpies
Aside from the ink bleeding onto the inside, he thought he'd made a fairly nice and – this was most important – tactful card
He put on his coat again and set out for Mattia, in view of the floor meeting as he walked down the hall
He saw KMFE's drawing on Alice's door out of the corner of his eye
Penelope didn't live here so he couldn't leave her a drawing
As he passed Rohini's room she told him to come in
Rohini: You have to see what we've done to Amanda's hair Ria: Hey, Ulysses, isn't Amanda beautiful
Ulysses stepped around Rohini into the room
Amanda was sitting on a chair smiling
Ulysses: Yes, it looks very nice
Ria: awww Ulysses: Hey, you guys aren't at the floor meeting Ria: oh, pfff
Morgan'll understand
Rohini: Amanda's hair is more important
Right Amanda
Amanda: Of course
Rohini: What do you have in your hand
Ulysses: Oh, this is a card for Penelope
Rohini: Oh Penelope is that your girlfriend
Ulysses: yeah Rohini: Ooh is it something special
Can we see it
Here put it on the table
Ulysses: Actually, she's kind of upset right now
And I'd rather not show it to anyone yet
Rohini: Aww what's she upset about
You should bring her flowers
Ulysses: I know, I should
I've got to be there in half an hour
Rohini: Where is she
She's in Mattia, isn't she
Not good, not good
You better watch what she's up to in there
Like Katie and physics
I don't think so
Ulysses: Well, I mean she's upset because I've been busy the whole time she's been here
You know it's just after winter break and she's not used to me being busy
Rohini: Girlfriend needs to chill out
This is engineering school, you're going to be busy
Ria: Yeah it sucks though if you go to visit someone and they don't spend time with you
People have done that to me
Sorry, not to make you feel bad, Ulysses
Ulysses: Don't worry about it
Someone did it to me too
I know I should have spent more time with her
But my schedule's still a mess
I don't want to get stuck with the wrong classes
Rohini: Oh yeah that sucks
That could mess up your whole semester
Tell her to chill out and you'll see her some other time
Are you going over there now
Ulysses: Yeah
I have thirty minutes to see her before she flips out
Rohini: Oh go then
Sorry for distracting you
Hurry up go
Ulysses: All right see you later
As he walked past Justine's room she invited him to watch House with her
Ulysses: Is anyone at the floor meeting
Justine: Oh is there a floor meeting right now
I didn't get an email about it
Morgan usually sends emails
Ulysses: I just talked to Morgan half an hour ago
Justine: Well why aren't you there
Ulysses: Penelope's upset that I haven't spent time with her
She's in Chris's room and I'm going over there now
Justine: That sounds
awkward
Well have fun
Ulysses: Thanks, you too
There was a Matlab study session in the lobby
A lot of people from other dorms crowded the tables with laptops
Sonali saw Ulysses walking by
Sonali: Hey Ulysses can you help me with Matlab
Ulysses: Um, I have a little time, I guess
What are you working on
Sonali: Oh not if you're busy
It's the recitation problems
I'm stuck on number 7
It says use a for loop and I don't remember how to do that
But if you need to go somewhere you can help me some other time
Ulysses: Ok
um
Sonali: When are you coming back
Ulysses: Some time tonight
I'm not sure
Maybe like an hour
Sonali: All right well can you knock on my door when you get back
Ulysses: Sure
He weaved through the Matlab crowd and got out the door
Then he walked over to Mattia, and called Penelope asking if she'd let him in the building
After about five minutes the door opened
It was Andrew
Andrew: Hey, someone told me you might be here
Ulysses: Yeah, I need to, like, see Penelope or something
Um
you know where she is
Andrew
She's in Chris's room
I was just there, I would know
Are you any good at ping pong
Ulysses: Um, I used to be ok
Um, I like need to see Penelope now
I think she's getting upset
Andrew: She's not upset
I just saw her, she was definitely not upset
Come on, it'll take two minutes
We'll play to 11
Ulysses: Some other time, Andrew
Andrew: But you won't be here another time
When was the last time you came to Mattia
Ulysses: Uh, it was for a presentation by Dean Brown on the cheating policy
That was last semester
Andrew: Exactly
You're never hear, so you might as well play ping pong now
Ulysses: I'll play to 5
Andrew: All right, then
Rally for serve
He bounced the ball over the net, and Ulysses hit it back just as Penelope walked in
She was smiling and Ulysses thought she looked not at all upset
Penelope: Ooh let me play Andrew
Andrew: Here, we've just started, take Ulysses's spot
Ulysses handed her his paddle, which she waved around a bit and then asked Ulysses to go get a padded one from Chris's room
Ulysses left as Penelope and Andrew started playing
Chris was sitting on his bed doing physics homework
Ulysses realized he'd left the card under the ping pong table
He asked Chris for the paddle, Chris got up and found it
As Ulysses was leaving
Chris called out Chris: Hey, would you like to stay here and do physics with us
Ulysses: Being who
Chris: Me and Penelope and Andrew
Ulysses: They're playing ping pong
I'm sorry, I really need to go see Penelope now
This is just not good
Penelope and Andrew weren't in the lobby when Ulysses got back
He called Penelope
Penelope: Oh, hey, we uh went to visit Abby
We'll be back in a few minutes
Ulysses: Abby lives right across the hall from me
Directly across
Five feet away
Penelope: I know
But you're still in Mattia, aren't you
Ulysses: Why didn't you just visit Abby before
I could have been there
Penelope: Look, we'll be back in a few minutes
Just stay where you are
Ulysses went to sit in a big cushy chair
After a couple minutes he got bored and went to play piano
With his right hand he played one note over and over again, against chords with his left
It made him feel better
About twenty minutes later Andrew and Penelope got back
Andrew: Hey, you're pretty good at piano
Ulysses: Really
I thought I was just playing the same note over and over again
Andrew: Well it sounded pretty good
I'd ask you if you can play any of the music I listen to but I'm guessing the answer's no
Penelope: Ulysses, I'm sorry you're upset
Ulysses: I'm not upset
Penelope: Promise me
Oh hey we never finished that game
Penelope and Andrew played duce to 27-25
After that Penelope was worried about Ulysses so she brought him into the stairwell to talk
Penelope: Are you upset because we didn't tell you we were going to visit Abby
Ulysses: What
No
No, I'm not upset
I thought you were going to be mad at me
You threatened to spend the night in Chris's room if I didn't go see you
Penelope: Oh, I didn't want you to come see me
I was just worried you'd spend all day on your computer
So I asked you to come to Mattia
I thought it would be fun
Come let's play ping pong
As they were walking back through the hallway Penelope added Penelope: And I might actually want to spend the night in Chris's room
Ulysses: Penelope, can you please tell me what you mean by that
Andrew saw them and offered Penelope a rematch
She agreed and they started playing
Ulysses: Penelope
Can you answer the question
Penelope: I'm kind of in the middle of a game right now
Ulysses: I just
maybe between points
Penelope paused dramatically and held the ball against the table
Penelope: I'm working on an essay for school and it's good to do it in Chris's room because he's working on physics
Ulysses: I see
Then they went back to playing ping pong
Ulysses went back to playing piano but realized he didn't really need to be here
He said goodbye to Penelope and went back to his room
He didn't talk to her until next morning before she left
She knocked on his door at 11:30 Sunday morning to get her backpack
Penelope: All right, I'm leaving
My train's in an hour
Ulysses: We didn't get to see each other much
Penelope: I'm sorry
We were both really busy
Ulysses: I'll try not to be busy next time you visit
Penelope: It's ok if you are
I'll probably be busy
Ulysses: It's funny
I thought you would be really upset, and Aditi offered to come talk to you
Penelope: Aw, you should have let her
Ulysses: That would
that would not have been good
Aditi has a way of causing trouble
Penelope: I'm immune to trouble
Ulysses: I think she's not careful, and she makes people jealous
And she's very unsympathetic
I mean, she's always nice to me, but
I would not like to get on her bad side
Penelope: I would assume so
Ulysses: You don't know her
Penelope: Yes
Penelope left for the bus stop
Ulysses got back to dealing with his schedule
At some point he remembered the card, still under the ping pong table in Mattia, but decided not to worry about it
Late that night he sent Penelope an email, telling her he missed her more than he realized he would, and mentioning the card
Two days later Penelope wrote back
She told him not to worry so much
It's freshman year, he's got three years of college ahead of him and a whole world around him
There's no need to worry about her
Ulysses never wrote back
Kmfe was driven into a period of thought by the next picture
It was of Adolf Hitler, the memory from centuries ago, shown in a simple, clear, black-and-white photograph
This would, to most people, imagined kmfe, be nothing more than a reminder of the horrible time that was
But to me it is more
Having thought what I have, the type of things I do think about, it is a metaphor, or worse, a reality, more dire
It proves that there is another bank to the river that I would follow
It came down over the hills, rolling into the valley where the train tracks are
It looked orange and glittery, and it moved fast
KMFE jumped over the guard rail into a snarl of thorns
He was barefoot and in shorts
He fought his way 30 feet down a steep bank to the tracks
Then he sat against the wall under the bridge and waited, with his hands over his ears, his eyes closed, and his head between his knees
When the wave passed over him it made a bang sound, then his skin felt stinging, and then it got very hot
He didn't look up to see what was going on
After about 10 minutes he realized that he wasn't really hurt in any way
He couldn't be sure of that until he started moving
But the heat had subsided, the noise was gone, and he felt no pain
First he removed his hands from his ears
Then he placed his hands over his eyes to check that there was no dust or gravel there
Everything seemed clean
With his hands still in front of his face, he slowly opened his eyes
He could see normally
He waited another minute then took his hands away and looked around him
Things actually didn't look that bad
There was a great deal of ash along the tracks on either side of the bridge, and some burnt looking branches and stuff
But nothing looked majorly beat up, and the bridge looked OK from underneath
His glasses were somewhere, probably up the bank he had come down, but then they'd be in the path of the fire
His hair and clothes showed no signs of burning, and the bridge had shielded him from the ash
Now the question was what to do with this situation
It stood to reason that a lot of people had been hurt or killed by the fire, and probably a lot of houses had been damaged or burned down completely
Perhaps his own house had been affected
But even that didn't seem as big an issue as whatever caused the fire
Because it didn't look like a regular forest fire: not hot enough, left too quickly and didn't do much damage
Then there's the fact that there hasn't been an out of control fire anywhere near here in any history that KMFE knew about
So that left the possibility that the fire was man-made
Perhaps an explosion at an oil refinery or a chemical plant
So there was some risk of poisonous chemicals
Then it could have been a terrorist attack of sorts, or if things were really bad, a military action
But those two possibilities seemed unlikely, especially since there had been no sign of planes, helicopters or large vehicles that might be expected to respond to a national security issue
Then again emergency vehicles would probably have responded to a chemical plant explosion, and so far KMFE had heard nothing
He decided to risk climbing back up to the road
Nothing was burning now, and he could feel no heat
It was actually way easier walking up the bank now that the brush had been burned
He found his glasses next to the guard rail, but they were melted beyond use
The road had significantly more ash than the tracks
The view from the top of the bridge had been altered dramatically by the absence of surrounding trees, the tops of which had been burned off
KMFE could see charred landscape a long way off
There was nothing green in sight
It took him a few minutes to realize that the houses that used to be a few hundred feet up the hill were no longer there
So the damage had been more than he had at first realized
And the bulk of it had happened within a minute
Something powerful had happened here
This thought made him consider going back under the bridge in case whatever it was happened again
It was probably worth staying down there at least for the rest of the day
It's not like he was in urgent need of going anywhere, and he had no idea what other dangers were still in the planning stage
He walked back over to the guard rail and saw :P
KMFE: OK, is this gonna be some Twilight Zone thing where we're the last people alive
But kind of sad
Actually it would be really sad
And not even that cool, because it would get boring
It would be better if you were more entertaining
KMFE: So
I was just under the bridge
You didn't notice me
Haha just kidding
See you don't even know cause you might have been oblivious
KMFE: This isn't going well
I'm going back under the bridge
Have fun
See you
KMFE went back under the bridge and sat there until well into the night
He realized he really missed :P right now, especially because he might not have anyone else to talk to for a long time
She had wandered off and he hadn't even looked which direction
It wasn't that bad for loneliness, though, because whatever was going on it was a terrific mystery, and probably a great story if only he knew the details
He spent a lot of time speculating on what could have caused all this mess
Problem was he didn't have much to go on and he ran out of ideas
Then his thoughts turned to wondering why :P seemed so unconcerned with this whole situation
That was an easier question to speculate on, because he knew :P and thought he could somewhat understand her behavior
Actually, now that he thought about it, he didn't understand her behavior one bit
And since she seemed so unusually cool with the catastrophic events, she probably knew a great deal that he didn't, which meant he really had no good information to work with
That made the thought of talking to :P even more appealing
But it was probably futile at this point, and still could be dangerous
Then of course the thought crossed his mind that :P might in some way be responsible for the fire
This seemed like an awful lot of work for just one person, but any time he tried to estimate what :P was capable of he always undershot by a few orders of magnitude
On principle, then, he should refuse to talk to her, since she had just killed at least a few thousand pleope
But that's not a real convincing principle
First because it's hard to see why just because somebody did something really awful, you shouldn't talk to them
Heck it's not even clear that you shouldn't still respect them as a person
Is a murderer worth less than a more peaceful person
Are they less of a human being
Now that kind of philosophical pondering made KMFE feel a bit guilty because he really had no idea whether :P was involved at all, and to jump right into deciding how to blame her seemed unfair to her possible innocence
So until he had evidence to the contrary, he would assume that :P had done nothing wrong
At this point KMFE realized that the only individual person he had thought of in the last few hours was :P
This made sense since she was the only person he knew for sure was still alive and nearbyish
But there was strong evidence that other unnamed people continued to play a huge rule in his life right now, in particular those responsible for the fire, if indeed people were responsible
I used to make up really crazy stuff
I only have vague memories, these cardboard creatures or something
I had no preference for reality
One of my earliest memories is of me telling my mother that I didn't mind being alone because I just told myself stories
It was so true
I always told myself stories
Later as patterns emerged I have memories of the stories
A hero emerged named Hes, who was really more of a prankster I suppose
But it still totally ignored the real world, just gaining some internal consistency
I remember a few recurring elements, but they aren't real things
There were these things called points, and glass bowls of fire, and very strong glue, but those are not good descriptions
There was another world in another universe, where everything was gray (Sometimes I thought the rug in my room was that world, or the shower curtain)
My cousins and I had many other stories
I can't even begin to remember them all, but I remember we played sea animals
We told Mr
Mayo stories
We had stories for almost everything we did
Mr
Mayo got out of his mayo bed, put on his mayo suit, walked out of his mayo house along the mayo sidewalk, tripped on a mayo rock fell on the mayo ground and got mayo in his face
Later we made a galactic world
The Dark Force Republic, Nark, the Barren Planet, Gedding 25
Those were good stories
We spent a long time just telling stories
We picked up D&D for awhile, but I think we didn't care much for the game itself
We liked the stories
We made up a whole world for that too, with Lord Ecth, Lord Needle, the City of Steel
It was a beautiful world
More often than not we would set aside the dice and just tell the stories
Eventually we began to care more about people
The stories focused more on characters
Real people entered the stories in made-up roles
At some point we began telling real stories
There was still a good deal of imagination, but the characters were real, the situations were real, and there was a vague sense of the difference between fact and fiction
We were telling things that had already happened, and then adding on speculation and interpretation
The stories I told myself took a similar turn
I can remember in middle school making up epic tales involving people I knew
As time went on, these stories became more and more realistic
There were no more aliens, no more magic
I started to care more whether the story was plausible
At some point I stopped making up stories
I was analyzing, predicting, planning, but not inventing
I knew the difference between fact and fiction
I didn't ever think about Needle or Ecth
So now I don't tell stories anymore
I have become a clear-thinking person
I know what's real
I could feel the heaviness of the sky pushing down on me
The air was like deep water, and I was drowning in it
Drowning in air, it was an odd thought: I told myself to remember that
It was just the perfect day for what was now happening: nothing
I walked up to the plaster wall of the building, where, conveniently, a door had been placed
That was nice of them
Ascending the stairs I eventually found myself in my own apartment face to face with the past
Everything about the room was yelling some memory at me
It could be described as a graveyard except not quite that peaceful
Even the color of the paint on the walls meant something, if nothing more than that it was the same color, that exact same shade and exact same hue, that had been present for so many events in the most recent history of my life
I had not been in my apartment for fifteen minutes when a new face of the past showed itself
There was a knock at the door
I pondered for the first time why Andrew looked so unlike his brother
I'm Jonathon's cousin
Do you know him
It was somewhat odd that he did not introduce himself as Andrew's cousin, but I was glad of that
I wasn't sure how I would react if the first thing he said was to mention Andrew
By the way do you know when he's coming back
He seemed very happy about it
I was drafted at the same time and place he was
So I heard a lot about you
Less than he should have, I imagined
I too was delighted that Jonathon was coming back but I made no obvious indication to that effect
Also, there really had been no draft, but I knew that Jonathan called it that in the letters he wrote, and I suppose others did too
I also heard about Andrew
Oh well
Like about how you came to London
My past was not my friend
I had grown up as a Taranta, which was a small gypsy band that I have since lost track of
By birth, I was the lowest member of the band, and by the time I was twelve was almost a slave
That was a torturous time
When I was fifteen I couldn't take it any longer, and decided to leave
I had convinced my brother to come with me
We escaped and within days were on a cargo ship to the US
I did not loose track of him until crossing the Channel to my current home
KMFE apparently knew very little of this, from the story he had started to relate
I had missed the beginning, having just realized he was talking
He said you used to live in the US, but had to leave
He said there must have been some stories of that time, or the journey to London that scared you
And Andrew
Jonathon says you told him things you had never told anyone before
He was right, though, something must have scared him
But what about me
I probably tried so hard to forget it that I had no time to be afraid
Yeah right
It was the bus ride West that had been the worst
Perhaps, I now thought, that was why, and where, I had cut off the past
It was not really worthy of the word 'bus ride' but I had convinced myself to call it that then and still mentally referred to it by that name
I still remembered vividly the dark, damp, interior of the bus, the noise, the stench, the blood
There was the one traveler who I remembered had particularly scared me: He waving his arms around, and making stabbing motions with an imaginary knife in his genuinely bloody hand, wailing something that sounded like ''Why would I kill him
Why would I kill my friend
This unknown person  held up a large gray lump
It's my brain
See it
On the other side was someone lying down because they had one leg missing
He was always yelling at my brother, and before we had reached the end of the line the two were engaged in constant fighting
Before things reached disaster we fled out the back of the bus without waiting for it to stop
It would not be unusual if that singularly awful event was what made the past so much my enemy
It was appropriate that after the bus ride things almost began to get better
There was no relic of my past life hiding in London
I was the only proof of what had happened
Yet even that seemed to be too much
KMFE was still talking
I think if it hadn't been for me there would have seemed to be nothing hidden
So he concluded, and I had to eventually agree with him, that you were scared to repeat Andrew
So I began to wonder if everyone is like Andrew, sort of scared of reality, uncomfortable wherever they don't have control
He must like that vacuum-cleaner dog thing because it is his and only his: he made it, he controls it
He didn't want to be this awful thing, but he very much wanted to create and control this type of thing
He called it a 'living home cleaning device', and it was a rather hideous looking blend between a dog and the essential components of a vacuum cleaner
Introducing it to me he had said ''too bad you can't get rid of the dog too and just have a living vacuum cleaner
Of course, he consistently ignored me in preference to this object
I was confused at first because I spent a lot of time writing poetry and had showed almost all of it to Andrew
What did KMFE know about this one
He continued, ''You showed it to Jonathon later
He guessed that Andrew must have seen it too
It was something about drowning
Drowning in a heavy cloud
I can't remember exactly, but I doubt Jonathon was inaccurate when he described it as 'dark'
It was metaphorical
So it might have been drowning under the cruel water of Andrew, but I'm guessing not
It was probably something in the past
And I don't know this for sure, but I bet that it terrified Andrew
As I said, he doesn't like things that are too real
And even a metaphor like that can bee too real
It obviously was something bad, but the details still eluded me
I did remember that when I was very young, I had almost drowned, and not metaphorically
It was a deep pit of mud, and I had been pushed into it by an older Taranta
It was after a rare rain, and in the dry area where I had always lived I had never learned to swim
I sank under quickly, and it seemed like hours, at least far more than I ever want to submerge myself in mud or water again, before the perpetrator pulled me out
I wonder if it was that instance that gave the metaphor in the drowning poem
Either way, as soon as I got to London I  taught myself to swim
Whatever it was, whether from the far past or a more recent image of something, it was right of Jonathon to judge that it had scared Andrew
KMFE was now talking about Jonathan
I had not been paying attention, but he seemed not to notice or not to mind
It's like his memory summarizes everything and forgets the details
You can get the general nature of events just fine, but try to get just one detail, and he forgets
It was like an art, the rambling story, but I was not feeling patient for it
Right, what were we talking about
A phone call
Anyway, I, so I really wanted to know something that would characterize this Andrew person, right, because I had never met him and I was intrigued
So I pressed him for details (details can be far more interesting than his vague summaries) and he mentions something that had really annoyed Andrew
You didn't appreciate this, and it had been like this for over a week, so you told him, naturally, to forget the living home cleaning apparatus and talk to you
And it annoyed him
I couldn't believe it, but he was genuinely angry about you wanting to talk to him
Seems harmless, right
But it really annoyed him
It was probably another angle of why Andrew had eventually left altogether
Here he wasn't even slipping away yet
At the same time, though, he was beginning to realize that what he wanted from me: a person so much like his vacuum cleaner dog that he could command it however he wished or ignore it when he did not want to see it, was not what he was going to get, or even possible
I wonder, after he left did he keep seeking his image of the perfect girl or did he realize his delusion and give up trying
Or was he so shocked by his own foolishness that he secluded into the world of his muskets and his hacking and his weird inventions
But then, how had I reacted
Was I in just a very different state of fear
Well, there was certainly the fear for the baby, that I might have had no one but myself to care for it
I first began to fear for its future when Jonathan was 'drafted'
I might have known that Andrew would have been as heartless, but I had almost taken for granted that Jonathan would still be there
The war created the possibility that I would never see Jonathan again
Luckily, he had never been in combat, and had survived to his present return home
I remembered clearly the day Andrew left
The wind, blowing with malicious strength that day, had knocked a very large tree in front of the front door, and I had been spending the last two hours cutting it up and moving it
Two hours earlier he had refused to come and help me, so I had climbed out of a second floor window (the first flow windows  cannot open) and been nearly knocked off the roof by the still raging wind
I saw him drive by
He might have seen me but he did not indicate this
He looked straight ahead and paid no attention
That was the last I ever saw of him
Now was one week later
I always wanted to meet Andrew, but I never did
Jonathan wanted me to meet him too, but there was never time, what with the war, and now Andrew is gone and no one knows where he is
Once I wanted to meat him to find out what he was really thinking
But I think I know that now
I just wanted to tell him to stop trying to fit the world to himself
It's almost like he thought he could just keep searching for perfection instead of working for it
Jonathan is so unlike his brother
Now it was truly the past: summarized and acknowledged, known, not feared, and behind me
I just want to meet Jonathan again
The future was not behind me yet, and I might just meet it as I had before: with confidence
Their disagreement probably went back to very old differences in perspective
It turned out you couldn't see the sky from her window
EKA: I imagine her like Kim Ross
She's got an entire world in her life
KMFE: She's really not going anywhere now
Her simulations are beautiful, but she won't be knocking down buildings with her mind
EKA: I'd be more worried if she were less alone
My biggest fear was that she might get distracted
Knocking down buildings is a distraction
He was implicitly saying that the present disagreement went back to the time KMFE met her
EKA considered pretending not to understand, since nothing is more frustrating than a really clever allusion that goes unnoticed
KMFE: You know I'm referring to :P
They were walking along the river now in Philadelphia
Next they turned on to Market Street
It prodded at him until he sleepily wandered out of the building
Back in his dorm in Quad 1 he fell asleep several times in the shower, with the noisy fights of other guys just getting up calling him back to reality
The air at the Quads bus stop was cold and slightly misty
He leaned against the bus shelter wall looking at the fall colored leaves until a bus full of people he had never seen before and people he somewhat recognized took him to Busch campus for his first class
On his way to SERC Jeff stopped and collapsed in the wet grass in the middle of the engineering quad
You see he was trying to find just the right moment to fall apart – he had to be careful not to waste it
He would fall right into your arms
Maybe he'd end up in someone else's, but it's really all about you
He lay there all by his lonesome
An angel came down out of the magical blue and orange sky
She had massive gray wings and a shiny black bass guitar, and as she played (Smoke on the Water) the whole earth shook
She wore black leather pants and a white frilly shirt
Her shoulder-length light blond hair moved about in the wind as she flew downwards
She had come to rescue Jeff
Ecstatic, he jumped up
11” He waved
He tried again
My name is Jeff
She pulled Jeff up off the lawn and took him to her home on a cloud
They lived there together for several weeks among the other angels
Jeff liked being the only mortal
He could tell stories about humans to the angels, who were remarkably ignorant of what went on on the ground below them
He could listen to angel stories, which had a thought process completely different from anything a human would ever think of
Angel stories have no concept of time
They talk about everything as if it all happened at once, and yet you always get the sense that something more is about to happen
The angel who rescued Jeff was named Steph
She was the only one who could understand what Jeff meant by loneliness
He got so frustrated trying to explain the word to the rest of them
They never believed that the word really meant something, and then later they would forget he had even tried to tell them
Steph said she could hear loneliness, and play it on her guitar
She told Jeff that even in a world full of angels the sound of loneliness is clear if you listen
After about a week Jeff brought up the subject of humans
They were sitting together on the edge of their cloud looking down on an endless sea of prairie
No one you know has every been here
After Jeff had looked around for her he asked an angel named Spiros
No
you don't
She was gone the next day and the day after that
Jeff started to get bored and irritated with the angels
They couldn't understand most of what he said, and when they did understand they didn't remember
They always thought he was making things up, especially emotions like happiness or boredom, and then they would make fun of him for it
Eventually he got tired of living on the cloud
He got tired of the angels
He got tired of living in a place where no one he knew had ever been
He let a rainstorm carry him back to earth
Then he texted Shasha happy thanksgiving
So I made this whiteboard
Put masking tape on the cinder block, clear packaging tape over that
So I can write on it as I'm falling asleep
Problem is it's on the wall where everyone can see it
So I still watch what I say
Erin: He's in the castle
Alex: Mr
Answer told me
He told me that Chris said something the automatic translator couldn't handle, and so they took him off of Earth
He's not in the castle, but he might be alive
Erin: Oh right, I remember him saying something that sounded a little strange
Alex: Erin, if you remember everything, how do you act so calm all the time
Erin: You do realize that my conception of calm is very different than yours
Alex: But think about it
What kind of a crime is that
Saying something that can't be translated
Erin: Maybe that's not the right way of looking at it
Alex: Pretty clearly
Erin: I don't think Mr
Answer meant to say it was a crime
I don't think they saw it as a crime
It's just a strategic move
Perhaps based on some statistical trend
No one's saying Chris did anything bad
Alex: But can they just take an innocent person off of Earth
Erin didn't answer
Alex wondered if she was having trouble with the translation of the word "innocent"
He was tired of talking to Erin
She was interesting
She wasn't from Earth, she wasn't human, and she always had a new perspective on things
But she was so
insensitive about Chris
So, what was REALLY wrong with doing something manipulative to an innocent person
What's wrong with being manipulative in general
Well, you can go back to morality as a consequence of empathy
It's bad to be manipulative because it makes people feel bad, and you can see that they feel bad, and they are human beings so you feel bad about that
Or you feel guilty
Or other people expect you to feel guilty
And it's BAD
So, one part of that has to be tweaked, specifically the reference to humanity, since the people who took Chris away probably aren't human
Is there empathy among life in general
Not
always, for sure
What about among intelligent life
Civilized life
Actually, thinking about it made Alex feel sort of just helpless and apathetic
Maybe Erin did have a good way of looking at it
She just kept pretending Chris was in the castle
Or really that building without lights that you can only see at sunset
Which would be a nice place to imagine someone
Strange thing is, Erin used to really like Chris
Really liked talking to him
And now she couldn't do that
Whether or not Chris is alive or on Earth or in the castle, Erin isn't talking to him
Maybe it doesn't matter to her because she remembers everything
It's not theoretically possible to remember everything, is it
Maybe someday her memory will be all used up and then she'll just stop learning
She'll just relive it all in her mind, including her experiences with Chris
I don't think she particularly likes me now, though
Though
Huh
I wonder what she thinks about that
You know those big plastic tic-tac-toe games that they have on playgrounds
They look like their only appeal is that they won't kill anyone
This one had braille on the pieces (that said “X” and “O” (with a caps symbol))
But two of the pieces were upside down, turning the braille into something else (non-braille X and O don't get affected, so it's not very noticeable if you aren't looking at the braille)
I thought that was pretty funny, and not knowing braille too well I wanted to write down the letters so I could look up what they turned into
I didn't have paper or pencil, so n lent me some
She's very careful about making sure people pay her back for stuff, and she jokingly said that I owe her a small scrap of paper
Of course she didn't really care about the paper, and I knew that, but I'd take any excuse to see n
So six months later (I had lost the original piece of paper) I cut out a new one about the same size, and then didn't quite feel foolish enough to drive all the way to her house (not even knowing if she's home) to give her a small scrap of paper
So I gave it to Socrates to give to Taylor to give to n
But that makes sense
I saw Socrates in robotics, and he plays D&D with Taylor, and Taylor is n's brother
Socrates was rather puzzled, but then admitted “Well, it IS n” and said he'd better be safe and deliver it
Turned out n had already left for college, so she didn't get it, but I got message back some time later that she said I was “insane”
There was so much I owe you that I didn't pay back, though
Like an honest explanation for why I'd remember a scrap of paper you gave me six months ago
And I never thanked you for giving me something to think about so many times
Something distant, yet not unhappy, and that didn't make me feel sick
And I never thanked you for the story you created in my life
It's not exactly a happy story
And it trails off in an almost tragic way
But it's a story worth living, and I wouldn't have lived it without you
It makes me feel cold to think what PL might have said to you
Maybe someday temptation will get to me and I will show her the story
That would be mean, and it would make her feel guilty (not that she isn't guilty)
I wonder what it's like to be magical like you
Then I wonder what it's like to be magical, except like PL
Couldn't she just have left me alone
She wandered into my life and took over
It was like being run over by a train
It was also very big, very thick, and very, at this time of day, opaque, but mostly it was up
It was always hanging far above everyone; they saw it but they did not touch it
S
Elliot went to college he obviously doesn't remember it so great because if he did he'd know it's  September's the cruelest month for exactly the reason he said
That's when you see everyone you haven't seen all summer, and realize that all of a sudden they're part of your life again
Rutgers's campus makes this especially confusing
People end up living so far away from where they used to
People you used to see everyday now you only see occasionally on the bus
Sometimes it's like they just vanished
I pretty much never see AR this semester
Should have been OK since I didn't see her or talk to her at all this summer (except for a brief episode with Jeff near the end), but, well, here I am back at school where it for some reason matters again
And it's no easier that it all of a sudden matters for Jeff too
Jeff did not know AR last year, except for what he heard from me
He confused her pretty good trying to talk to her
I tried to explain it to AR
See these things we talk about most of the time
Classes, homework, buses, normal stuff
Jeff decided there's not enough meaning in that
He went after "the stuff you daydream about, or think just before you fall asleep" is how I put it
Now, I can't talk the way Jeff does, or think the way Jeff does
But I always sort of thought, perhaps erroneously, that his way of thinking really was a better way to understand things
Maybe it's a bit awkward, but it always seemed to me that if you could get passed that, and have a Jeff-like conversation with someone, you'd understand them way better
But AR disagreed
And that really puzzled me
She avoided Jeff-like thought not simply because it was hard or uncomfortable, but because she really didn't want to think that way
Not even a little
And she couldn't understand how someone would
September isn't even over yet
Right now things with AR stand in a sort of non-equilibrium state
Nothing bad, just
something's going to have to fall one way or the other some time
Maybe tomorrow
Everyone remembers the time Mr
Peles said "oh snap
Not everyone, but todo el mundo
Como decía la Señora Rivera
That was quite a class
It had a certain charm
And a certain mystery
Like, well, many people
PL: But who in particular was I thinking
KMFE: What if I just don't care what you were thinking
Is it really a mystery if it was never important to me to begin with
PL: I guess you wouldn't care what I'm thinking
You don't want to
KMFE: Look, it's not even the point whether I care or not
PL: What is the point then
KMFE: I don't like it when the only reason I care is that you've tried hard to be secretive
It feels like you're just manipulating me, and it feels mean
Jo: On the other hand, if you really did want to care you wouldn't have complained about that
KMFE: I wouldn't have complained about it anyway if it hadn't been bothering me for a long time
She used to brag that she could talk in circles around people and confuse them
But do you realize what that means
If it's just her talking, then it's just her being a jerk for no reason, and if her victim tries to understand and gets confused, it's because they CARE, and they trust her to say something useful
Maybe honesty is a weakness, but is it a bad thing
KMFE: And then she would laugh
There's an ant wandering around on the floor
I want to ask "does the ant ever get lonely" but I have a suspicion that questions like that only make sense from the perspective of a human
Or a personified object or animal
Is the moon lonely
That's just as good a question
The answer to that one's gotta be yes
Are some questions better than others
Can a question ever mean anything if you don't have a reason for asking it
How did the word "why" acquire such strange philosophical meanings
All it wants to ask is qué pasa
Why did you look at me that way
Why didn't you call
Why did it rain today
Those are really all the same type of question
But a one-to-one-correspondence is fundamental to the whole idea of numbers
It's the reason that five pencils is the same number as five erasers, because you can pair them off into a one-to-one correspondence
So it's the reason that numbers exist independently of the things they're counting
Counting numbers, that is, like integers and various infinities
Real numbers is a different story
Which is the point that my elementary school math classes missed so completely when they always had us write in a unit for the numbers in every problem
And of course I had the nerve to ask "why do we have to have a unit
Why can't they just be numbers
Then again Cantor's pretty verbose and awkward about it when he defines cardinals
So I guess you can't blame my math teacher for not figuring out that fairly deep insight right on the spot like that
And of course I was just sick of having to write in something like cats or puppies for every assignment when the numbers came out the same way no matter what
Which is, in essence, the reason numbers exist at all
And of course I remember that because it bothered me that I couldn't get my point across
And then years later I learned I had been right, in a sense, for the wrong reason
And then it bothered me that I always trusted other people more than myself and had to unlearn so much of what I learned in elementary school, and in middle school, and even a bit of high school (the high school unlearning probably isn't over yet - though the greatest lies to unlearn are unlikely to be of the simple, factual kind)

KMFE: I have
I can give you a summary
KMFE's summary  ll told me that PL ruined his life
He introduced me to this idea while PL left, as she explained it, to go murder someone with a fork
She did not really do that
I was eating an apple that PL had given me, and that ll advised me to check for needle marks
Some time later she told me she had once pushed someone off a cliff in New Mexico
All of these are false
But ll said that PL had done things so terrible to him that he could not bear to recall them
Maybe he'd write them down to be read after his death
I said I'd like to read it
I assumed her to be a powerful person
Her love of evil and ll's real experience thereof fascinated me
So I talked about it a lot with David
After working on a Spanish assignment, I told him the story over ping pong
We used a fake name
David picked the name Penelope because he said it was the worst name he could think of
I told him that Penelope had ruined somebody's life
David was drawn into the fascination and for weeks tried to figure out who Penelope was
Eventually he did
It was while I still saw PL as a formidable person, while I still thought of n as amazing, when I still pitied with fascination ll's misfortune, that PL decided, very slowly, that she liked me
And I thought she was too powerful to do anything but accept
So I forgot about n
David didn't forget about Penelope
He disapproved, but he never told me
He just got awkward and embarrassed
So we didn't talk much after that
I gave him a nice drawing more than a year later
I shouldn't have ever told PL the code name Penelope, but I did, eventually
ll forgot that PL had ruined his life
He denied having told me so
PL never told me exactly what she did
But she gave me a clue
She told me about Shadow of a Door
She lied that shadow was not her, later explaining this was to protect ll from the truth
I don't know what ll knows
I feel sorry but I don't want to bother him now
So, here's how it goes
You're talking to someone online
It's a nice conversation, you understand each other, you're both reasonably attentive and you're glad you're talking
Then you need to go do something, so you say goodbye
A couple hours later you come back
Problem is, las conversation ended so nicely, you don't want to go through that all again
You'd have to give actual effort into talking and understanding, otherwise it would feel off
And that would ruin the nice feeling you had before
So you don't talk to them
This person that you really like talking to, you don't talk to them, because it won't be shiny
We must let today sit before commenting on it
Suffice it to say that
well, this really will have to wait
Just it
would be best not to
Leave that topic for a boring PEE lecture
Same for
other things that happened today
They are not
well they're not warm and fuzzy like running into ASG in Busch dining hall
Not at all like that
And
A warning -- do NOT get cryptic with AR
This would not be a good thing
It would be unpleasant for everyone
That would be one topic
Another topic is why that makes me feel guilty
Because the cause of it really does seem to be
And that begs the question how much I actually care about her
And how much was just caring about me
So
why does it make me feel guilty, and how come when I see it in other people it makes me annoyed
This is the perfect time to discuss SH, because here I am most guilty of it
say you consciously realize what you like and dislike in your interactions with other people
And
you seek out things you like
OK that sounds like just usual
How do I make this more specific
An example
Jeff and holding hands
Oh well
I'm still more guilty of it
It just bugs me
She says it's "OK"
He told this to me
It's awesome
Jeff: That's because you're an asshole
So
what is the point here
Why does it bother me to
put a ranking on "holding hands"
Is it because it's focusing on something that I see as the consequence of your relationship with someone else, not a defining aspect of it
I know PL doesn't agree with me on this one
In fact she pretty much hates my way of thinking
And I think it would be uncomfortable for Jeff
he wouldn't hate it so much as not want it to apply to his life
Which is why it would be best to keep the ASG and Jeff worlds separate
Predictions
AR and Sean are not going to end well
The analysis is wrong, and the conclusion is probably (hopefully) wrong too, but might as well give it
AR has a lot of frustration to let out
Over school, over people
This is a good time to do that
But it's going to be tough
And people can only take so much
Jo: What was it
KMFE: All right, I'll need to explain the situation to you, so you can see how it was PERFECTLY NATURAL for me to say what I said, and how it was obviously the right thing to say
Jo: All right
KMFE: So the officer thought it was strange that I was walking around at 2 AM with no shoes on
And so I was talking about what I was doing, trying to convince him it was legit
Officer: You're out pretty late
You know it's like 1, 2 AM
KMFE: Yeah I know that
So, here's what I've noticed
There's this one stretch of road on 324 that's not nice to walk on, and if I leave the house just around 12 (I don't usually look at a watch when I get there, so I don't know what time it is then, but I notice when I leave the house) there's about a 50% chance of meeting a car there
At 1 it becomes like 10%, after 2 there's almost no chance
Last night I left at 12 and met a car
Tonight I left at 1 and, well, we'll see
Officer: What do you do when you meet a car
KMFE: I get off the road
But I don't like that, you see, because it's not a real nice place to get off the road
There's poison ivy and you never know when there'll be a dead animal
You see, there's that house there, I think it's the Johnson's place
Anyway some big fence along the road there
And the deer like to stand in between the road and the fence, I think they drink water from the ditch there
And then when a car comes they jump out
So a lot of dead animals along that stretch
You see the problem is they can't go back because of the fence, and they can't go along the road because the trees are so thick
Now when I go walking past there they don't notice me as fast as the cars so they get stuck
If I had like a machete I could get them so easy
KMFE: That is the line that upset the officer
But you can see how that makes perfect sense
I mean obviously if the deer are stuck between you and a fence, the thought is going to cross your mind that you are a predator and they are prey, and that you should be taking advantage of this situation
And I bet if he were in that situation he'd think the same thing
But instead he just asked me all sorts of tricky questions about do I own any weapons and did I ever own weapons
It was tiresome
You know really, I like deer
I sympathize with them
Because they're causing all sort of problems, they're killing people, they're wrecking the ecosystem, and they have no idea
They're completely clueless
They're just like people
And I look at them standing out in a field or something and I wonder if they even suspect anything
Do they realize how overpopulated they are
Well, people realize what's going on and we haven't done much about it
Actually that's not true, we've done a lot
But we could stand to do a whole lot more
But do the deer ever get to thinking about why there are road signs with pictures of them, guys sitting in trees shooting at them, contentious meetings talking about them
And do they ever notice the overpopulation
But anyway, I think they're a lot lke us
I didn't before
But now you never understand a thing I say
Or even try to
Though it's not because you aren't leet enough to figure out my codes
It's because my codes are more or less arbitrary
But there's another side to cryptic conversation
And that's the listener
You are being very careful not to understand what I say
You don't want to understand
I have to stop talking to you
Permanently
Now's a bad time for this, because I don't want to think that I'm mad at you for not waking me up
That would not be true
But I'll risk sending the wrong message because it's worth it
I have a deeper fear
Because I remember how you convinced me n was scary
What did you tell n about me
And you still talk to n
I don't want you to be a permanent curse on my life

Why waste your creativity on something no one will appreciate
The same thing probably applied to painting with glue
PPC came back into the room
When I showed up, her eyes looked red
She was pacing around with a blank expression on her face
She told me she'd been crying all morning, but couldn't say why
First she had to finish her project  for physics, then go to the piano recital
She had to build something to launch a tennis ball 20 feet or so
She nailed together some two-by-fours, attached a hammer that could swing and hit the ball
Now, here's where I think she must have been really upset
No, here's where I could see how upset she was
Because anyone could have seen that a little hammer swinging on a nail is not going to send a tennis ball 20 feet
But she had so little desire to actually make the thing work, that it was good enough
Or not really good enough
But she wasn't going to think it through any further
She smashed the nails into the wood on the floor of the shed, then watched the ball fly about 2 feet and said OK now I have to go to the recital
Much later, she said she had been crying because she wanted to see if she could get away from me
She thought
she had been relying on me too much and needed to be independent
When she told me that, it was not a good time for me, and it made me angry
I wonder if she was right
It made me angry because
she had been upset, inside, mostly hidden, for months
Really actually miserable inside
And
if she had been trying to get away from me
couldn't she have
said something
Instead of telling me over and over that she didn't know why she was upset, and it had nothing to do with me
Well, most of the time people don't do things for a reason
So I believe she really didn't know why she was sad
Oh

He held his stomach with his hands
He started saying numbers to himself
The period is usually a highly composite number
I knew about n before, from Robotics
From scouting
Because I sat for many many hours in front of a computer entering in scouting data, and it became obvious that one person put a lot more thought into it than anyone else and that was n
So I fell in love with her name on the top of the page, and it wasn't long before I made the connection to the actual person
You see, there's something powerful about having your entire world for two days defined by little pieces of paper with data on them
It makes the name on the sheet seem like a real person
So I loved n
That was on a friday when I discovered her
Before that I didn't know she existed
I guess I had seen her and heard about her somewhat
She was in another section of woodshop, with Jeff de Lucca
A few years later I remembered that Jeff and n knew each other and I thought that was very nice
Then I found out that Jeff thought that n tried to ignore him
Oh well
So when PL told me about n she told me how awesome n was, which I already knew
And she told me how much I am like n, which I had already started to figure out and dream up
She told it to both of us right in front of us in the library, and we were both too shy to say anything
But she was right
n and I are the same person, we just have had different lives
I'll never know what n thought of me because PL never told me
And PL is the least trustworthy source I know, so I won't ask now
I don't want her rationalization for what happened next
Oh my god the memory of that time in the library is powerful
That
was a terrible thing to lose
I didn't even say anything to n
We just knew – I knew, and I don't care what PL would say, n knew too – that somehow we weren't each a complete anomaly because we were the same person
And there were at least two of us
I miss n so much
The time looking out the cafeteria window on that other friday that wasn't so great, on physics day when I saw that person all alone eating pizza with a fork and that memory makes me feel a little less like I've lost something because I guess I wasn't as possessed by n not to notice that person, that day isn't anything compared to having PL say right in front of us that there is someone else in the world like me and that person is n, the most amazing person I have ever known
But at some point PL stopped telling me how amazing n was
She started to try and tell the new story, that n is scary, and she only seems nice on the surface
That is complete BS
Sure n has an intense personality, and is surely dangerous in a fight
And sure she used to be really violent and fight a lot
But you know what
me too
And that's just a little piece of the story
That's the piece you tell me because I'm stuck and I don't know anything and I have no choice but to accept whatever you want to tell me
That's the piece you tell me because you know I am paralyzed by my own shyness, by my own desperate desire to think that there is at least one other person in the world who thinks somewhat like me, that you can make up any story you want
And it can be completely true and it will still be a lie
That's when you tell me that n is really scary underneath, and I came up with the line about people who pretend to be scary, and now looking back on it wonder if maybe that means I had started to see through the cracks in the beautiful story of n already and didn't need you to tell me how scary n is but I know that that's not true
It's not n that disillusioned me
It's you, and you're a person just like n and so if you were scary underneath I could be cynical about n too
And it's mostly just that I'm cynical in general
It's got nothing to do with n - she's perfect
Ugh that word is bad too
It doesn't nearly describe n
That's that word I used for you that became so awful and disgusting
And I should never have used it to describe n
It's a nasty word
But I bought it
Because what else could I do
I was nothing and you were this powerful person who I used to compare to god because you seemed to control people
And you called people your puppets
But did that mean I had to believe you
Did I really have to throw away everything I had dreamed about n
Occasionally I can still recall what I felt about n
But it's really fading
It's going to be gone soon
And most of the time I'm so cold and emotionless
That's one of the few things that
mattered
And I let you take it from me
I was just a puppet and by the time I became a real boy it was too late
He'd been mean shutting her out of his life, he knew
He just couldn't face it
Or, he couldn't
something
This would be improved by a better word
But he had to ask her one thing
He'd probably only get one chance
She might give him an honest answer once, but probably not a second time
So he had to be very careful and not waste it
She was too proud to give honesty away so easily
He got out his notebook to plan what he'd say
Maybe he should start this some other time
Later at night when he's not thinking so clearly
But he started now
He ended up with this letter:  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////  PL,  I'm sorry for this, but I have a question that matters to me
In my world you were always powerful
You controlled many people
Possibly not as many as you liked to pretend, nowhere near as powerfully as I used to imagine, but certainly you did have a decent amount of control over many people
It was a cheerful sort of power
It was a game
I suppose it may not have been obvious that to others, parts of that game were real
To me, it was real
I wasn't playing
So looking back on that, I realize that much of what my life is now is the product of that game
And I don't know how it worked
Not in a deep philosophical sense
I don't know what parts of my life were affected
And that matters to me
Because that's who I am
So I have an unreasonable request
I want to know what you did
How did you deliberately affect my life
You won't remember everything
But you will remember a lot
You do remember
There are many ways you could give an unhelpful and somewhat disingenuous answer
You could say you forget
You could give a vague summary
You could say you never really had any control over my life
Please do not do any of those things
For you it will be a few painful memories, but for me the answer will be permanent
I am completely in your hands here
He had to avoid describing how much he had come to resent the influence she once held over him
He had to avoid suggesting that pride might prevent her from answering
He had to avoid telling her that she might not be able to give a useful answer, because then she would latch onto that
Actually, that's one of the things that PL disliked about KMFE
During the time he had known her, he had learned to phrase questions very carefully, with the aim of getting an answer
Maybe she thought he didn't deserve answers
No, that was a silly way to say it
KMFE really thought that PL wanted to have complete control over what she told KMFE, and didn't like him to have any influence over that process
That was reasonable, he supposed
But she should have warned him that she would assume control over what he thought
It wasn't nice to spring it on him like that
PL managed to be unhelpful
She responded a few days later saying that she changes anyone with whom she interacts, and whatever she did intentionally made no extraordinary impact
Oh well, KMFE had wasted his chance, but it might be for the better
Because it preserved the mystery
KMFE thought it interesting that PL answered the question in terms of her own thoughts and feelings
Maybe KMFE had misjudged what was important to PL
Perhaps if she had manipulated ll, even to the point he thought she had ruined his life, that that was not anything more formidable than a smile in the hallway
But it mattered to ll, didn't it
Or maybe it only mattered in the right kind of story
Then she asked “And do you still talk to RE or NL
KMFE: Ok, I know what it means
But did she really mean that
Jo: Why don't you ask her
KMFE: I tried
Jo: You didn't do it very well
What did you say at the time
KMFE: I explained why I do not talk to those people much anymore
KMFE: I didn't talk to them, either
KMFE: I forget what I said about NL
I may have said good riddance with her
For RE there were other issues
I wasn't always tactful towards her
Jo: Nice use of the word 'tactful' there
You could say you weren't nice to her
KMFE: I see what you mean
Oh well
KMFE: We always talk about me, don't we
Jo: You know all about me from PPC
KMFE: It can't be everything
Jo: If I want to say more I'll tell you a story
Jo: Would you like to hear a sad story
KMFE: It's only fair
Jo: OK, so there's a man sitting in a room
He's being held prisoner
Because he tried to get people thinking
He wanted to get the whole world to think, but his ideas were too free, and they seemed perverse
Now he's trapped
Jo: And as he's in the room, he sees his lips turning blue
And he thinks, they're filling the room with CO₂ and I'm going to suffocate
So he stands up as high as he can, to where there will still be oxygen
Jo: And just before he passes out, he realizes it wasn't CO₂, it was neon, and so it rose to the top and standing up killed up quicker
Because he's a thinker, so he realizes it, but he's a doer, so he doesn't realize his mistake soon enough
KMFE: When he passes out and falls down, can he get oxygen again
Jo: Yes
But they do it the next day with CO₂, and he dies
KMFE: My, what an exciting way to go
Jo: But do you see the symbolism in it
KMFE: I think you admire that man
Jo: Do you really think so
I think I just like the idea behind it
KMFE: What if I told you you are that man
Jo: I wouldn't really care, honestly
I thought it was a cool idea, that's all
Jo: All right, fine, you want to hear another story
KMFE: Go ahead
Jo: So a man dies and he goes to heaven
It's not a cloudy dreamy paradise, but it is an afterlife
And he thinks, wow, humans must be really special if the cosmos still cares about us after we die
Jo: And he feels very happy to be honored like this
Jo: That's heaven
KMFE: Now I suppose you're going to talk about hell
Jo: Yes
So a guy dies and goes to hell
Jo: It's the same, he gets there and is surprised to see that there really is an afterlife
I mean, who knew
Jo: But then he thinks that everyone must be a little surprised like that when they die
So he feels uncreative
That's hell
KMFE: Feeling uncreative is hell
I feel uncreative all the time
Jo: It's a metaphor, KMFE
KMFE: I'll tell a story
KMFE: So there's this guy named Dave
He lives in an apartment in Hamilton
He has very little money, but he's mostly ok with that
KMFE: After he accidentally put his foot through his TV screen he doesn't have much to do at night except play guitar, so he does that
KMFE: His guitar's the only expensive thing he owns now
KMFE: He paints houses for money
Which works out well because the paint fumes save him money on d
KMFE: He occasionally hangs out to play music with some people who don't respect him much
But that's ok
He doesn't want much respect
KMFE: Then his guitar gets stolen
And that's pretty hard
KMFE: He thinks maybe he should leave Hamilton, go somewhere else, redo his life
KMFE: But then he thinks, come on, it's just a guitar
Get over it
KMFE: So he stopped playing
KMFE: Ten years later he was working as an accountant and bored out of his mind, thought he'd try and take up guitar again
KMFE: But he was so out of practice he sucked at it and that discouraged him
So he gave up
So that's that
When South Jersey invaded North Jersey, between 700 and 800 "political prisoners" were locked up
More than half were released within a month, but some were held for much longer
KMFE is currently a political prisoner being held in Trenton
He likes to think that he's being held for a long time because he's dangerous, but he knows that's probably not the case
Sentences seemed pretty arbitrary as far as he could tell
But since it's been three weeks since the Jersey Civil War was postponed in a ceasefire agreement, and since now it looks like 80% (though being locked up he can't get at real data, unless he had had the foresight to count) of political prisoners have been released, there must be something that motivates them to keep him here
Now he's not in a terrible hurry to get out, but it would be nice
He certainly hasn't been entertaining thoughts of escape
But he managed to make the guards really suspicious
Basically, the prison's a pretty interesting place
At least for KMFE who's never been in one before
So KMFE and David spend a lot of time exploring the physical infrastructure -- wires, pipes, walls and that kind of stuff
They like to figure out how everything's connected to everything else, and what different wires go to and stuff
Just for curiosity
But the guards don't like that
It makes them think KMFE and David are thinking about either escaping or starting some kind of commotion
The guards are also worried that other prisoners will think something's up and it will increase the chances of a fight breaking out
So they move David to a different section of the prison where he won't be able to talk to KMFE
So that's when KMFE and David started using codes
A few years ago they had come up with this pretty simple cipher
It worked like this
It used base-10 encoding, with each letter represented by 2 digits
A message was encrypted using a passphrase and salt, e
g
passphrase 31 45 92 63 87 23 25 57 81 39 salt       39 27 83 58 29 67 65 83 26 92  And also two 100-length sequences of digits A and B, that are the same for all messages:  A 9260965810 1429855532 0161322054 8674661454 6880787552 7543898313 7094683940 4084185032 3087588310 6908588882  B 1955125315 6938125425 5122876509 5100915466 1477211855 5388565337 2192305861 7764605983 4683451187 8289411107  And then of course the encoded message:  72 97 10 81 02 32 97 32 11 41 11 99  You start with an invisible pointer at the start of each sequence
Take the current digit in A, advance that many places in the salt
Take that digit and advance that many places in the passphrase
Take those two digits and advance that many places in A, then take those two digits and advance that many places in B
Add the digit in B to the current digit in the message, then add to that the current salt digit
Then advance 37 digits in A and 59 in B
Repeat until the whole message is encoded
So for example, to encode the first digit, take the digit 9 from A, giving 9 in the salt, giving 72 in the passphrase, giving 84 in A, giving 4 in B, added to 7 gives 1
Using base 10 means you can do this in your head
The sequences A and B are kept written down, the salt is written with the encrypted message, and the passphrase is memorized
David: Do you think this is really secure
KMFE: No
It would probably take a good cryptanalyst 10 minutes to crack it
But then again it's not like anyone's going to try
This is security by obscurity, and also by no one caring
Later he observed KMFE: It's basically a big hashing function to create a keypad
Which means it's probably trivial to crack
But now in prison it really was convenient that they had it
KMFE just hoped David remembered how it work, and remembered the passphrase they had agreed upon so long ago
Neither of them had the numbers for A and B, but those need not be kept secret; KMFE could just make some new ones and get them delivered to David
KMFE generated some random-ish numbers by scribbling all over a sheet of graph paper
The line can exit each square either through the top, left, right or bottom, giving two random bits
The problem is there is tremendous correlation from one to the next
So KMFE repeats the process 50 times and XORS them together, giving something that looks pretty random
Then he goes through the tedious conversion to base 10, but at least he only has to do it once
He makes two copies of the blocks
Then he writes and encodes his first message, which says "Bit of a b4d situashun, eh
He doesn't remember if they agreed on minus 30, but he guesses David will figure it out
The deliberate misspellings might make it harder to crack, but he really has no idea
He gets the message passed from person to person
He gets a message back "I figured out what the blue wire is for"
They continue talking like this for two weeks, until they screw everything up
Basically, they have no urgent need to escape
But once they start figuring out how things work around here, it gets really tempting just to see how much you really know
So when they figure out which wire might be discretely cut to cause a door to fail to lock when it should without triggering an alarm, they have to see if they're really right about that
I mean what's the worst that could happen
Well, it didn't set the alarm off, but it blue a big chunk out of the wall
That got the guards' attention
The guards quickly discovered that KMFE and David had been sending each other coded notes, and though they had no other evidence, they highly suspected KMFE and David were behind the explosion
Right now they had KMFE in a room asking him tricky questions
KMFE was in turn trying to give tricky answers
Not because he really had anything to hide, but just because he was bored and this seemed like a source of entertainment
The guards were focusing on the codes KMFE and David had been sending each other
KMFE tried to tell them that that was pretty silly
If he's going to tell them anything about the codes, he might as well tell them what the codes were communicating
But maybe the guards wanted the coded messages as evidence
They'd managed to collect about 5 of them
Guard: KMFE, you're acting pretty clever
KMFE: Oh cool thanks
Guard: Clever's not a compliment
Have you heard of the prisoner's dilemma
KMFE: Of course
Guard: All right, good
Then you should know that the dominant strategy is for you to tell us how the cipher works
KMFE: Oh come on it's this stupid little thing David and I came up with two years ago
You could crack it so easy
Guard: Look, it's not like most prisons employ cryptanalysts
It's not really something that comes up a lot
Especially these days when most people use RSA and stuff
You tell us how to decipher the codes, and we won't put you in the Long Wing
KMFE: Haha, see, you can't actually control the whole game
It might not be a dominant strategy for me to tell you
But even that's a moot point
Guard: Explain
KMFE: David doesn't know the cipher
KMFE was relying on David's reliably negative reaction to pressure
If David were right now being asked tricky questions in a dimly lit room, there's no way he'd remember how the cipher worked
Guard: David is the one you were sending the messages to, correct
KMFE: Correct
Guard: And you claim that David doesn't know the cipher
If David doesn't know the cipher, how did he decrypt them
KMFE: Gosh, I don't know
Guard: Stop that
You know
David knows the cipher
Now tell me how the cipher works
KMFE: Just fine, thank you
Guard: Stop that
Tell me how the cipher works
This went on for five more hours
KMFE guessed that David had succeeded in forgetting how to add 1 plus 1, and that David's interrogator must be quite baffled by now
KMFE: I don't understand why you need the cipher so badly
Why can't I just tell you what the messages say
Guard: Tell me what the messages say
KMFE: No
Guard: OK, look
We need the cipher so that we can prove what went on yesterday
Just asking you questions isn't going to bear enough weight
We need physical pieces of paper that were written before the incident
This is not just about you
This is about the prison system, and accountability
This matters to a lot of people who you don't even know
And you're making they're lives hard, and possibly dangerous if the ceasefire falls apart, but not giving us the documentation we need
Now KMFE finally understood why the cared about the cipher
If he just told them what the messages said, there'd be no way of checking it
On the other hand, if he made up a cipher, there's no way of checking that
He started adding numbers in his head
Just need to buy a little more time with some wise-assery
KMFE: If it affects that many people, can't you just hire a cryptanalyst
I mean it's not like they're in high demand elsewhere
Guard: Nor is it like we can just hire one on the spot at 3AM
There is an urgency to this situation you are not grasping
KMFE has used the A and B charts enough that he's memorized them
He doesn't know if the guards have those, but they probably do
He doesn't have the intercepted messages in front of him, but he can remember what they are, mostly
He doesn't remember all the misspellings, but if those don't decrypt right, it will just look like more misspellings
David might remember that the first 20 digits are salt, but that doesn't mean he has to use the salt
He just has to let it come out as gibberish
After stalling 20 minutes longer, he's ready
KMFE: OK, look, we've wasted enough time here
Lemme just tell you, because there's no real secret
It's just a big keypad
He proceeded to list the digits he'd been calculating in his head
He turned the messages into innocuous things like "What's up dawg
The guard seemed mildly disappointed but mostly just happy to get it over with
He let KMFE back to his cell
She had made him jealous, when he learned that she wasn't alone
There had been other worlds with life, but no one else like him
Now that that was all a game, he could relate to her again
He thought that in this type of situation he ought to find a fellow sufferer and they could smile ruefully together as they stared into the sunset and thought about their fate
Well, that wasn't happening
In fact, there really weren't any fellow sufferers he particularly wanted to see right now
He wrote an emotional, reflective story, though it was rather dull and had no plot, about what he had just learned
Then he sent it to Jeff
He would have liked to send it to many people, but that would be mean
Actually, that was something else to ask Jeff about
KMFE: How mean would it be to let PL read the scary story
Jeff: Pretty mean
You should forgive her
KMFE: I did
Jeff: To her maybe, not to you
KMFE: But anger makes for such nice stories
It was the homogeneous kind with the curious tendency for growing fantastical children who live in dreams
People like n (with the amazing drawing)
That kind of fantasy world n lived in is the one I wish I shared, but I am hopelessly realistic
After that, Jo's family moved to another group of identical houses in Louisiana
This one was surrounded by a 12 foot high wall
The was one entrance with a guard house, and a sturdy metal gate closed from 10pm to 5am
During those hours anyone was forbidden in the streets
The community was all-white, in the middle of a mostly black urban area
The guards reportedly gave a hard time to black people seeking to enter the gate, even invited guests
Rumor had it that just 20 years ago this community had a nonbinding policy against interracial marriages
There had been a few non-white residents in previous years, but none for the 4 years that Jo's family lived there
The community was strict in those ways they could manage
There was no roller blading, skate boarding was something unheard of
Bikes had to be registered with the town council
If you left something - say a tennis ball - on your lawn overnight the police would confiscate it
It's funny how people react to these changes by becoming more divisive, not less
And the lack of color in the external appearance is made up for by a strange and longing color in dreams
But these things always come with a theme of sadness
During this time Jo's parents divorced
Her mother and father both lived in the walled-off bubble until Jo and her mother moved to RLG, where Chuck now lives
KMFE always seemed to talk about PL in the coldest, most pessimistic way
Jo didn't believe PL could have caused as much damage as that
But this was obviously a source of stories
KMFE learned to think in stories through his cousin, and some of the best had been about Jo
She was a wonderful source of stories, and it was through stories that KMFE got to know her
KMFE said he didn't know what more to tell about PL
Of course he could think of something
They were sitting together against a building on a street in New CKRG
KMFE's story  There was this lie she told me
It spanned pretty much our entire relationship, from the time she told it, to the time I found out it was a lie
By that time I just asked, and, with the usual arguing, she told me the truth
She had a livejournal called shadowofadoor
Officially, I suspect I shouldn't be telling you that
But it's a very old story
You won't learn anything
Nothing you care about, at least
Shadow
there was a story behind her
I don't know it fully
Shadow tortured ll, that's all I know
That's what PL told me
Shadow found ll, and took control of him
Shadow found ll before PL, before anyone
Claire handed ll off to Shadow when ll moved, and that began ll's new phase of captivity
But Shadow was mean to ll
And played with his life
She just talked to him
But that can be mean
Especially when you take someone like ll who will care
That's the worst part of it
Make fun of someone who knows you're just being mean if you must, but don't toy with someone in ways that matter
And don't assume you know what matters
Because you don't, you really really don't
And then Shadow handed over the task to PL, as it had been handed her from Claire
The task of inventing ll's world, and playing cruel games with him
That make PL laugh
I do hate laughter
So PL was worried that I would look at what shadowofadoor had done, and judge her by it
I guess I look at that pretty cynically now
PL was worried I'd know the truth
Well, I should, shouldn't I
Even if you don't like the truth, it still seems mean to lie about it
So she told me this story
And she made sure I knew, whenever I brought up Shadow, that Shadow wasn't always her
That there used to be someone else who did all those evil things
And I did bring it up several times
I was very curious
I did a drawing about it
Well, you probably know the answer already
It seems obvious now
I guess what you have to understand is that at the time I trusted PL
I really trusted everything she said and I never thought for a moment that she would lie to me
So when I brought it up much later I was shocked
Because I had been under the impression that she started out honest, and only started lying to me when things got bad
But she had lied to me about Shadow right from the beginning
Consistently, repeatedly, and with a purpose
She tried to deny it, as she always does
First she denied lying to me about it
She said she must have just mentioned it once
But I remembered it clearly many times
Then she said that it was sort of not a lie, because she did think of herself as a different person when she wrote for Shadow
That's an excuse she used a lot
I don't buy it
Then she said it was to protect ll
Because she was worried that if I knew the truth, I might tell ll
At the time of this revelation, all I was thinking was that she had lied so perversely
I wasn't thinking about ll
But now I think, that was very mean to ll
She should not have hid that from him, and she should not have manipulated people he knew in order to hide it
Finally she said that she lied accidentally
I know that's not true either
But there was nothing I could do to change the reality of what she had done
And I couldn't reach her emotionally, anymore
So she was going to drift away and leave me with this story
Now that's what I've got
She was the most dishonest person I ever knew
She lied in ways I didn't even know existed
And in my short experience with her she never grew out of it
KMFE: I have to admit I don't really care much anymore
Or maybe I just don't want to hear about it
Jo: That's good
KMFE: I'd rather you didn't say that
Because I don't think it is good
Jo: It means you've moved on
KMFE: I don't know how to explain it but I don't think that's good
Jo: It's not good to move on
KMFE: Like, I don't know
But if something still means something, it just doesn't seem right to set it aside like that
Jo: But lots of things mean something
Something will just replace it
KMFE: I don't know how to say it
That's just not right
I can't explain it
Maybe it's because I feel like PL found me, manipulated me, and then left so that we could move on
There was never a time when I was both free and able to tell her something
So she doesn't know
She doesn't know what she really did to me
Because in order for me to realize what had happened she had to be gone
Jo: But if it doesn't matter to you anymore, why does PL need to know
KMFE: I guess she doesn't
But at the very least can't I repair the story
Jo: I don't know, this obsession over the story
I think you could say that about anything
KMFE: There I just sent the email
Jo: To PL
KMFE: Yes
I explained what I meant
I gave an example
I'm not expecting a reply anytime soon
I don't know if I want a reply
KMFE: But that
but that's real
Jo: Real for whom
KMFE: All right
So on the mountain one time (long time ago) I met these two kids about my age walking two dogs
The weren't very big dogs but they were strong
Gave the kids quite a time walking them
They were called plot hounds
They're used for hunting
I asked these kids if they did a lot of hunting, and they said not much, because they play sports
So they don't have a lot of extra time
They both had a very strong (to the point I had a hard time understanding) Southern accent, but not the kind you usually associate with the South
Not like Bill Clinton or George Bush
Deeper than that
That's
that's about all there is to that story
Jo: That's a story
KMFE: Well, yeah, isn't it
I mean there's not much to it
But it's a story
Jo: So
what's the message
Why you telling me about these people
KMFE: I sort of wish I had talked to them more
They seemed interesting
Jo: So this is really about you
How you didn't used to talk to many people and so you missed out on some interesting ones
KMFE: Well, maybe
I don't know
Does there have to be a message
Jo: There's always a message
I think most of the time people say there's no message it's because they don't want to admit it
KMFE: Well all right fine
But I didn't
have a reason for telling it other than I was thinking about it
How about you tell one
Jo: OK this is about a girl named Sue
KMFE: Johnny Cash already did that one
Jo: Exactly
So instead of thinking "hey, that's a girl's name" people think "hey, that's from that song"
KMFE: Is this because you happen to be named Jo
Jo:  Jo can be a girl's name
Like Jo Annne
Anyway it doesn't make people think of Johnny Cash
KMFE: Or, maybe you wish it made people think of Johnny Cash
Jo: I'm quite happy not reminding people of Johnny Cash
KMFE: So why're you bringing it up
Jo: Because you asked me to tell a story
KMFE: All right go on with the story
Jo: OK, so his name makes people think of the "Girl Named Sue" song
And they keep pointing it out to him
And he gets so sick of it he refuses to respond and just looks at them in an upset way
KMFE: Sounds unpleasant
Jo: But none of it would be a problem if his parents had stayed in China
KMFE: Oh great
Jo: Exactly
So it upsets him how readily Americans will make fun of people's names
KMFE: Like your doing
Jo: No I'm not
This is a sympathetic story
KMFE: All right, fine
So Americans are jerks
Jo: And, well, that's all there is to the story
KMFE: So we're even then
Jo: Yes
We're even
It wasn't safe anymore
He didn't know how to pick a place to escape to, so he went to Alabama, figuring it was the last place they'd look for a liberal-minded fugitive
He was a mess at this point
He hadn't cut his hair or shaved in weeks
He had two sets of clothes that he kept in his backpack, along with his notebook
The shirt he was wearing now was severely torn
On it was written “Ellbur” as a nod to the Revolution he was sure only he would interpret
He was right now walking down a narrow, remote road, with thick bushes on both sides and no shade
It was a sunny day, and he hoped he'd get to the next town soon to buy sunscreen
He didn't know where the next town was
He felt a certain pride being a fugitive like this
It was better in Alabama where he didn't feel eyes on him all the time
A car drove by, stopped about fifty feet past him, then turned around and came back
The driver rolled down the window
In the car he clarified a few things
Yes, he was Ellbur, but his real name was KMFE
And yes, he was a communist, and was behind this revolution
In fact, he was its original architect
LOF was certainly not a communist, and he doubted she'd have any sympathy for the revolution, but he thought he'd be safe for a little while
Didn't have enough money to fly somewhere right now, but he'd work something out
But she had a surprise too
She was a participant of the Revolution
Two problems, of unknown significance, were asking to be rationalized
First there was the dilemma of an innocent victim in the plan's path
It was not nice to force such a thing on such an innocent victim, and not any better without explaining it to them
Alas, this was inevitable; the only harm done would be a little rudeness
The second problem, and, so far, the least, was the loss of a once-edible tomato
This too seemed a just expense
The tomato, having reached the perfect stage of far too ripe, was now resting peacefully in the bottom of a brown paper bag, enjoying its last minutes alive
The innocent victim was somewhere in another room
The specific room could be guessed
Anything could happen, but some things stubbornly don't
Some of that might be corrected with the aide of a simple tomato
The bag containing the tomato swung back and forth from the hand that suspended it
The bag was darker in color than the surrounding walls, but otherwise there was very little difference between the two enclosures
The tomato was content
The hand was not
The bag turned a corner, then another, stepping into a dusty, high-ceilinged room
The innocent victim stood just ten feet within, currently in the act of just what made them such a perfect victim
The other occupants of the room were not aware of how perfect this was
They might think it as imperfect, as they looked into the victims great mirror, and remained unaware
The hand was aware
The eyes were aware
They all looked at the victim, who was turning around to face the party
Such an immediate change, so abruptly it reacted
Just what was so perfect about this victim
For a start, it was not that they were to be the victim that was perfect; that was merely a side effect
What was perfect was that they did not, under any circumstances, want to be the victim
They would react to being the victim, and they would react in such a perfect way
They had the power that few had: they could order something, and have it honestly and deliberately be disobeyed
They were the symbol for what was not their fault, and yet as a symbol they could provide the first leap
The tomato rose from the bag and was soon all over the victim
The feet ran from the room
Perhaps it had begun at last
Jo: Wait, seriously
KMFE: Too much politeness gets in the way of the meaning
Then the first alarm from his alarm clock, then the second alarm from his cell phone which he accidentally snoozed
Then the second alarm from his alarm clock, then the third alarm from his cell phone, at which point he got out of bed
Then the snoozed cell phone alarm went off while he was leaning on his desk trying to wake up
The alarm system is very carefully designed
His alarm clock has a radio and a buzzer alarm, which makes two, and his cell phone has three alarms, for a total of five, which is usually enough to wake up
Also, there are two independent devices triggering the alarms, so if one fails there's a good chance the other one is still working
Both the cell phone and the alarm clock have batteries, so power isn't an issue; the biggest risk is that he'll screw up the settings
The order -- phone, clock, phone, clock, phone -- is also carefully chosen
He knows that until he gets to the last alarm he's just going to go back to sleep again
So it's critical that the first alarm in the sequence come from the same device as the last, so that if it doesn't work he'll know right away
And he trusts the cell phone more than the alarm clock, because the volume control is harder to bump, and it vibrates in his pocket so it can't fall off the table and end up too far away to hear
The only real problem with this sequence is it drags out the waking-up period
He needs to make sure he gets up because his Materials Processing professor checks and grades by attendance
Actually, KMFE really doubts that the professor looks at the sign-in sheets, but it's better to be safe
The next step is to really quietly (because his roommate is still sleeping) get undressed and go to the showers
It's annoying that KMFE and JPW's schedules don't line up well at all -- they never wake up early on the same day
KMFE has gotten good at not falling asleep in the shower
It's easy to forget a whole hour early in the morning like this
Especially when everyone else is being quiet
First he has to shower, then brush his teeth, then wash his glasses, then go get dressed
Then he gets his ID out of the second dresser drawer, turns off his cell phone and puts that in the same spot, unties his key from around the handle of his toiletry bucket and ties it to his belt loop, puts his ID in his left pocket and his key next to it, and puts two pencils and a pen in his right pocket
It's all got to be just this way
The pencils and the pen took awhile to get right, too
First, he can't use the noisy pencil sharpener in the morning, so he sharpens the pencils the night before
Then it's important to have both pencils and pens, because pencils can break and go dull, but pens can't be erased and might go dry temporarily
But it's also important not to carry too many of either, because then they might get lost
He still needs to figure out a better system than keeping his key in the same pocket as his school ID, because the key rubs against the plastic and wears it down
It hasn't affected the magnetic strip as far as he can tell, though
In his backpack he keeps the notebook he uses for random stuff, generally referred to as the everything notebook
It has extensive contact information on the cover that he wrote there the day after he left it in a classroom
He also has a few folders that always stay in his backpack -- one containing reference materials like a (Czech) periodic table, modular multiplication tables, Fibonacci sequences in modular arithmetic, a table of periods of these Fibonacci sequences, a table of the Euler phi function (which also serves as a short list of prime numbers), F, t, z, χ², Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon tables, random numbers, statistical formulas, campus building abbreviations, and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Undergraduate Handbook; one containing his schedule; one containing drawings, sheet music, assorted math stuff, TODO lists for some software projects, printouts of some stereograms, and graph paper
There are two copies of The Daily Targum in there, because he forgets to take them out
Among these he puts his binder for Materials Processing and the one for Linear Algebra
In the next pocket he keeps a ruler and a pencil case containing pencils, pens, pencil sharpeners, a campus map and an iClicker™
In the smallest pocket he keeps books to read, since he has to do a lot of riding and waiting for buses, which right now are Das Kapital, Faith and Practice, and The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul
He walks to the far stairs and heads out of the dorm, grabbing a copy of The Daily Targum
The cover story is completely irrelevant to him and not very interesting
Actually, that's the way it usually is with all the stories
He reads them anyway, and then reads the opinions page, which has a number of irritating problems
The editorials tend not to really take a side on the issue in question, and they always open with a "throw-away" paragraph that contributes nothing
Some of the columns are good, and some of them aren't
The political cartoon is sometimes good, but recently they haven't really been like political cartoons, just a silly joke that makes a reference to a political figure
Aren't political cartoons supposed to take a side on something
Then he reads the comics page, which is dec
He doesn't do this all at once
He reads between classes and on the bus, then finishes it back at his dorm if he doesn't finish it sooner
Right now he just sort of tries to read the cover story as he walks across the huge parking lot to the dining hall
It's really good they have oatmeal at the dining hall, because there's not much else at breakfast that he'd really enjoy eating
Luckily he usually doesn't wake up in time for breakfast anyway
He always gets to class way early
He likes it better that way
That way he doesn't have to get rushed into things the minute he walks in
So he takes off his coat, stuffs it under the chair, then sits down to read the Targum
At some point the professor comes in, nervously looks around the classroom, and starts setting up his laptop to display slides
Everyone in the room looks asleep
KMFE can tell the professor doesn't like that
The first day of class the professor said please try not to yawn in class
But it's not hard to imagine that sitting slouched in your chair with eyes half closed could have a similar effect to yawning
The lecture isn't really boring, it just goes on a long time
And KMFE isn't feeling terribly awake
So he has to make considerable effort not to yawn
He guesses it's probably pretty obvious
The professor talks about alumina, and kaolin, and montmorillonite, and mica, and zirconia, and titania, and that kind of stuff
It really would be rather interesting approached at in some way other than a lecture
The professor tries to keep people awake by asking questions, but he's not very good at it
An example exchange: The professor indicates a student in the front row
Professor: What's caustic soda
Student: Umm
I don't know
Professor: Why don't you know what caustic soda is
Student: Umm
maybe I used to know and I forgot
Professor: Come on, guys, what's soda, you drink soda
After enough silence, he finally says Professor: It's NaOH, you know, sodium hydroxide
All right, so the bauxite is dissolved in caustic soda
Yes, aluminum is made from bauxite
It reminds KMFE of something from a long time ago
Then he has Linear Algebra
This class goes too slow
I mean it's like we just do the same thing over and over again, and it isn't really that fascinating
I mean it would be interesting if we changed topic now and then
There's a trick now that KMFE and Charlie like to play
Well, not a trick really
So the story is, KMFE sits in a lot of classrooms waiting for class to start
This is a common experience
And there's usually stuff on the board from the last class
So he tries to figure out what the last class was doing
And it's always just little clues, because the professors don't write everything on the board, just little bits and pieces
And it's not even a representative sample, because some things warrant more board attention than others
So it's tricky and interesting and worth it to KMFE to spend a lot of time thinking about it
So he likes to leave some clues for the next class
At first, he and Charlie tried to make it look like a plausible class
But then they started going ridiculous
They drew matrixish brackets with strange drawings in them, arrows pointing all over the place, mathematical expressions with no meaning, lots of references to God, philosophy and history
One of KMFE's favorites was the integral of x² with respect to the empty set
Or Riemann with arbitrarily many ns
Or 1, 2,
Or "this would involve computation of the Riemann zeta function, an opportunity precluded by the difficulty of drawing a zeta"
Or Louis ω²
It's all fun
And then the professor for the next class comes in and immediately wipes it all off
Doesn't even look at it
Some of the students notice before it's gone, but KMFE's never sure how much attention anyone pays
But oh well
It's fun
And then say Hi to Aliyeh, who always acts cheerful even when not really, or maybe she is and even if things go bad she's still cheerful, and then to the dining hall, where AR isn't
She could be
Maybe she is
Actually KMFE doesn't look for her because he prefers not to look around the dining hall for fear of meeting people
It's not that there's anyone he doesn't want to meet
It's just that it's awkward meeting people and then there's the whether or not you should sit with them issue or invite them to sit with you and ugh
So he doesn't tend to look left or right or even very far ahead
And then back to his room to finish the Targum and work on an essay
And wish he could talk to AR
Well he could
Wish he
would talk to AR
That's the thing
KMFE used to be bothered by guys who would just tell a girl they liked her, talk to her without any hesitation or something like that
Now why did that bother him
He guessed because it used to seem manipulative
But he's decided that being subtle is bad too
Possibly worse
So he has come to admire guys who are not subtle
He has come to envy them
But right now he's keeping his door shut so in case he hears AR's voice it doesn't distract him for the rest of the evening
Because man it could
He's safe here in his room, in a sense, because no one will ever come and visit him
He's not entirely sure why
He guesses he's just not that fun to visit
Maybe he gives people the sense of wanting to be alone
But if he can hear AR talking, it will take over his mind
So it's best to keep the door shut
And then when JPW comes back, JPW starts watching Youtube videos and laughing
KMFE has no problem with this really, he just doesn't like to hear laughter
He's not really sure why
It's just not pleasant
So he goes to SERC to work on his essay
Where he spends most of the time pacing in the hallway or bathroom trying to think of what to write about
It's a process that usually works, but he has no clue why
He spends a week writing nothing but vague thoughts and the occasional emotional rant, pacing around and thinking what on earth is he actually going to say in this damned essay, and then on the night before it's due he realizes how it all fits together, he sees all the connections, and he writes it
Then he spends hours trying to make it intelligible
If he can succeed in the last step, it comes out good
This is how he has always written essays
He doesn't really understand the process
But it involves a lot of thinking, and not much writing
And it involves pacing
Or sometimes walking or running long distances
Or getting lost in Piscataway to better appreciate Into The Wild
Or going to Meeting and somehow not being able to actually think there, but being inspired by something somebody says, and running back in the rain, and watching the scenery change from campus to city to city-like campus to boring old Busch Campus, and thinking, now I must retreat into this bubble world, when just a few miles away is an exciting city where the store names are half in Spanish and there's people all over the place and big buildings and it would be cool to go back there, but this here on Busch is my world, and I have an essay to write, and unfortunately AR's door is closed
Setup
Try to explain why good and bad are relative, or fuzzy
When is a murder justified
Well, you can imagine that killing someone would save other people's lives
Reaction
People almost always try to find away to get around the murder
Is there some other option that will make the question moot
Can you restrain them instead of killing them
That makes the question of "is murder ever justified" very hard to actually ask, because you have to plow through a whole bunch of other stuff just to get to it
Is it that people just don't like thinking about it
Maybe they feel that if you're going to lead them on a strange hypothetical thought they need more background to be convinced of your integrity
At the end of the canonical story of Ella and Antonio, we don't know what happened to them, and are left to assume that they were killed by Crazy Jane
Some time after that story ends but before this one begins some more things must be learned,  - Ella did not in fact die, but she did not return home
Ella had always thought it would be sort of cool to be lonely
Not really lonely as in no people around, because that would be boring
More like lonely as in being detached from people, being in an unfamiliar place, or moving around a lot
Being far away from home
She decided to end up in a densely populated suburban area near Cleveland, OH, living in the upstairs of a small house on a dead-end street in a town no one she knew back home had ever heard of
Where she had no chance of running into anyone who would recognize her
As a general rule, it is very hard for an 11 year old girl to run off on her own and end up like that
But as Mr
Kowal would say, "This is my hypothetical"
14 years later, that is exactly how she did end up
She learned a few things in the experience
We're not really entitled to know most of them, partly because some things can only be learned by experience and partly because someone who is trying to learn what it is like to be lonely has got to keep a certain detachment from her audience
But she can share with us why being lonely didn't end up as fun as she thought it would be
To start, "lonely" isn't really the right word
It was more like she was creating two separate lives for herself
There was the one back home that she left, and the new one in some random suburb
It really only makes sense as part of a story
In that sense it serves to separate the person Ella from the plot in which she took part
If she can detach herself from all ongoing conflicts and issues, and live a totally new life, then you know that the person Ella is more than just a part of the story
The obvious problem, then, with being "lonely" is that while you are experiencing it you never see the whole story
Rather than gaining appreciation for the character's personality and understanding how that must have fit into her old life, when you are that character you just detach your mind more and more from things that aren't immediate
You can't live two stories at once
But that is not the worst problem
Ella discovered that what makes the story worth it, what makes it worth splitting your life into a parallel environment and undertaking some huge digression, is that at some point someone back home will know about it
That's what makes it real
In stories, things are real because they are observed
The more detached, the better when all is reconnected
Having everyone back home thing you're dead is even better
But really being detached just isn't so enlightening while it lasts
Basically it went like this
So Kereol went through a lot of trouble to rig the elections for the incumbent senators
They made no effort to hide it, as a snub to the election monitors
Problem was the size of the Senate had been increased significantly to comply with Korose rules
After the election, the incumbent senators invited the freshmen senators to a ceremony to kick off the new government
Sad thing was, the new senators actually trusted and respected the new government
They had good reason to
Even if Kereol went to a real democracy, it was unlikely to change policies much
The Kereol government really did have the support of the people, just not the power of the people
So the old politicians murdered all the freshmen senators at the ceremony
It was pretty slick, too
A few guys snuck around stabbing them with knives until people caught on
Then there was a big panic and the marked senators tried to get out, but it was a disorganized mess
The old guys didn't need to wall anyone off
It was just a big crowded event with a lot of people, and no good escape routes
Well, that put an end to the new government
It was also the ending of trust between the public and the government
Before the public had never been given a say
Now they had been given a say and it had been refused
I saw ghosts walking around it
There were these two people I haven't seen since middle school, and they walked right through a whole crowd of people and through the racks of cereal
It actually came off as rather cool, because his “I don't care who I knock over” attitude displayed an exquisite nonchalance
It worked better when he tried to walk through the real ghosts
You could tell he was a little proud of that
One time, when Jeff was there, she had told KMFE that he saw things differently than most people, and he countered that he saw things as they really are
So he'd bring that up now
Last time he said that it was about Brower being filled with demons shoveling coal
Should he mention that or :P
Well one was old, the other was too mysterious
Looking down from the top of the huge line of steps, KMFE could see that Brower was not at all filled with demons
In fact, it would have looked quite different if it had been
So he tried another angle of attack
He'd be ignored
He wouldn't start a religion
No one would ever remember him
It's not like he's particularly better than most people
This is also true of creation: the earth grows older in the same way people do
Thus the New and Old Testaments are tied together in that reinforcing analogy
But some people do
And they're scary and they give out Bibles on College Ave
It's handy because it's small
Just the New Testament, though
Then he imagined EKA criticizing him for being too detached from reality
Or something like that
Criticizing him for how he was thinking
AR didn't know the answer to that question
She had absorbed into her own mind
On their way out of the dining hall, AR ran ahead to catch a bus to Livingston
Then someone approached KMFE who would change his view of the world
But not the all encompassing world, that rules every life by pure nature
The personal, metaphorical world of Howard Brinton's analogy, the world that is like a person
AR didn't see KMFE again for two weeks
She eventually asked people and they hadn't seen him either
It irritated her a bit that he would disappear without explaining
But he always did that
It's why she could never completely trust him
I discovered AR, and dreamed about her for weeks
I never spent much time talking to her, though, because I never spent much time talking to anyone
She had a number of almost boyfriends throughout fall semester
Of course each one made me jealous
But seriously
if I don't even, you know, ask her out, what business is it of mine
One was Dave
He really liked her
I don't know if she liked him
He spent long hours in her room talking to her
I think I upset him
Because I
interfered
I came in wearing my Halloween costume of long brightly colored cloth strips and proceeded to monopolize the conversation
And it was revealed that Dave is a republican who will be voting for McCain, while I was going to go campaign for Obama tomorrow, and AR definitely preferred the latter
So I think that Dave did not appreciate that
I later told Deon that I thought I had offended Dave
Deon insisted that I had not
How would he know
It was nice of him to try and make me feel better, but I think he was wrong
But maybe if I said the same thing to Deon now he wouldn't try and argue against it
I don't think there's anything good about jealousy
It's an unpleasant feeling, and it's not constructive like sadness or loneliness can be
It's generally just bad
NL and RM used the sharpies to draw all over KMFE's arm
It didn't wash off for a week
NL took KMFE's calculator and set it on her side of the table
KMFE reached for it and she clawed up his hand
After that KMFE started growing his nails so he could fight back
KMFE happened to be wearing a shirt with a torn cuff that day
In chemistry, NT looked at KMFE's scarred hand and torn shirt and asked "Did you get mauled by a bear
She has long nails filed to points
He asked if NL was still violent, and they said "Yes, very"
A long time ago PL had offered to protect KMFE from NL
KMFE, like a fool, had told NL this
It got silence (or something like it) from NL
Once KMFE had explained to PL why he was disappointed to learn that she knew NL
He didn't remember being disappointed (now he surely would be) but he remembered the explanation
PL was an intimidating force even then
NL seemed much safer
To PL he had used the phrase "refreshingly simple", which now seemed condescending
Now he wished he could have remembered that bit of wisdom
That would have saved him from so much torture
NL thought PL was scary
KMFE would at the time have agreed, then would have hated himself for believing it, then later realized it was true
Like when PL claimed she had no shame, and KMFE thought "that cannot be true", and was annoyed that she would lie like that, until he was horrified to discover it to be true
PL didn't really like NL
NL was violent (like PL, but more persistently) and mean (again like PL, but more explicitly), both of which KMFE admired but which bothered PL
But NL liked PL and PL's friends and sat with them at lunch
And that's why the ever suspicious KMFE wondered with great discomfort what PL was implying when she said "and do you still talk to RE or NL
No, he knew what she was implying
But would she really do that
And he had tried to ask her, and her response is that deliberate manipulation is small compared to natural manipulation
KMFE was just so tired of dealing with PL that he didn't want to fight that
But how else would he know
KMFE still keeps his nails long
He gave up cutting them to points because that dulls them and makes them shorter
Once he broke a pointed nail opening a plastic-sealed bunch of paper after showing them off to n
That was supposed to be the day before he realized n existed
Old memories
Some from Onas
Wissahicken was a younger bunk on the boys' side
The best place to pick them was called Walker's Jackpot after the guy who discovered it
It was protected by poison ivy but we were not afraid
I ate a lot of blackberries, made me feel a little sick
We didn't cook them because one of the guys was allergic to jelly
George Bede gave everyone in our bunk nicknames
Our bunk was Cherokee
George's nickname was Bubble Boy because he slept in mosquito netting
I don't actually remember ever having an issue with mosquitoes but George wasn't taking any chances
It was pale green mosquito netting
He had the bunk above mine, then under mine the second week
So the nicknames weren't great
Mine was Testicle Head
George looked at me and said “did you know your head is exactly the shape of a testicle
So that was that
Turns out George went to the same school as my cousin
My cousin told me the story
George was talking to Carl about this guy he met at Onas, and he didn't say his name, but somehow Carl figured out it was me
So he passed the message on to me that “Bubble Boy says hi”
And Carl found out my nickname that way, though I pretended at first to not remember it
Adrian was interesting
He was from New York
He was sort of tough: he could do lots of knuckle pushups, he could fight, he could intimidate people
But he was subtle
He once demonstrated to people that he could win an argument with me by putting his hand around my neck and threatening to choke me
That might make it seem that Adrian and I didn't get along but that would be misleading
He was just intense
Adrian lectured us on a bunch of things
Actually I think we were all a little scared of him
The time he fell asleep with his music still playing, we talked for a long time about whether we should turn it off to save the battery, because we were scared of how we'd react
Eventually someone did turn it off, and Adrian was grateful and not at all threatening about it
One time at night he walked across the bunk and hit me on the cheek and walked back to his bed
I think I thanked him for it
You could learn a lot from him
He also lectured us about girls
He said don't be like George
When the situation is awkward, don't suggest something like “let's have a drinking contest”
Be calm and reasonable and don't do weird things to draw attention to yourself
I have no idea if that's good advice
Adrian said I was a good example to follow
I wonder if thats still true
We had many interesting debates in that bunk
We weren't especially cool or enterprising or clever people, but we could talk about things and it was fun
And we played magic a bit
So at the end when everyone was putting stuff in the fire we put in manna
We considered ourselves the lamest bunk, but we weren't that bad
We dressed George up really nice for the Mr and Mrs ugly contest
He had his shirt off with whipped cream all over his torso, and a bandanna tied around his chest
Then he had on underpants over his pants with a big blob of seaweed stuffed in them
He got second place
And we did a nice skit for the skit game
It involved violent and disgusting versions of various Onas activities
Such as leprechaun house destruction
But we weren't crafty
We debated a long time about whether or not to steal the sign for our own bunk
We were trying to imitate the success of Mackanack in stealing Cree's gnome
But we weren't cut out for that kind of game
And
steal our own sign
That might annoy Tristan, but no one else would care
Mackanack's trick was pretty good, though
It happened on visitation
Visitation is kind of …
interesting
First the girls come over and visit their brother bunks on the boys side
Cherokee was pretty pathetic
The hosts are supposed to plan something to do with their sister bunk, but we couldn't think of anything to do
That's when George suggested “let's have a drinking contest” and the night when Adrian lectured us on why not to do that
So we kicked a soccer ball around and talked
Mackanack was similarly unprepared
We probably had a lot of time to plan what to do, but it was one of those situations where no idea seems good enough to actually pursue, and in the end you get nothing
But our sister bunks were more prepared
They played us in a hand of poker, the winner gets to ask the loser to do one thing
They stacked the deck to win, then put make-up on us
A lot of people resisted, but I was fairly complacent
That's what Adrian used as an example in the lecture that night
Cree did the same thing to Mackanack
But while Mackanack was getting made-up, the sneaky guy (known as the “nipple guy”) whose name I do not remember snuck in and stole Cree's gnome
The next day they hung it
It got a lot of attention, and inspired us to maybe try something like stealing our own sign, but we simply weren't the trick playing types
The nipple guy liked our bunk, though
He would hang out with us a lot
We had a deal, that if he showed us the nipple trick, we'd get one of our guys to sing the gummy bear song
The nipple trick is he flicks his nipple with his finger and it shrinks
When you are in a bubble of all guys, things like that become socially acceptable, and then they become funny and popular
Everyone wanted to see the nipple trick
The guy who could sing the gummy bear song could sing it really well
In a clear high-pitched voice
It was very impressive
Bet he can't sing it that way now
I always felt like I gave up on Onas too soon
I really did stay the whole two weeks, but it felt like I wasn't really so much their for the last few days
Two weeks was just too long
I started to dread meals
I really should have just given up on playing the games at meals and just cleaned up the dishes every day
That would have made things much simpler
The games are so annoying
Everyone wants to just eat, and we're all really hungry because we don't get to eat all that often, and then we have to play games like pig and the drooling game
I do not like the drooling game
No one likes the drooling game
You have to tilt your head down with your mouth open and drool onto the plate
In one version, the last to drool loses
In another, the first to find it too unpleasant and give up loses
It's not a good game
But they have a system where it gets perpetuated
Most of the counselors are former campers, so they were subject to that kind of game, and they are every so slightly bitter about it
On the last day Mackanack gets to act like counselors, and boy did they make use of the drooling game
It seems like a playful game, but it really does leave a mark
There was a game in the Texas room called "Don't break the ice"
I played it with a guy who insisted he could beat anyone, but I kept beating him, and he kept insisting that I was doing it wrong
But I couldn't understand what the issue was, because I couldn't understand they way he phrased it
So that didn't get very far
Some from Middle School  I remember when the guidance counselor, whose name I no longer remember, came in to talk to us about learning and remembering stuff
He gave us an exercise where we were supposed to remember a bunch of words
Then he started talking to us about annoying teachers
Such as the kind who mumble and you can't understand anything, the kind who talk really fast and you can't keep up
And he said that no matter what, if you don't learn anything from that teacher, it's your fault
At the time this felt like a hostile way to put it
Because, well, what if the teacher really is unintelligible
Of course it's a realistic way to put it
I suppose what it amounts to is that the person who is able to affect how something comes out is not necessarily the one 'responsible' for the outcome
In this case, how the teacher teaches greatly affects how much the student learns, but the one officially responsible, according to the guidance counselor, is the student
So time the same year (this would be seventh grade), in CORE class (was that an acronym
They had pictures on them and stuff
I vaguely remember putting some photographs of me, and some printouts of code
I remember Manashika's had some HTML on it
I also remember an IE-specific tag (at the time, probably not anymore), <marquee>, and being ever so slightly put off by that
I put zig-zaggy paper things underneath the pictures on mine so it came out not all flat-like
Manishika told me that was extremely creative
A compliment from Manishika always meant a lot to me
One time (also in seventh grade, I believe
Seventh grade is the most decent year of middle school), I spent an entire recess walking around in circles thinking about trueness and falseness and logic and stuff
I forget what conclusion I was trying to come up with
I was walking around on the bricks just outside the cafeteria, and I remember Mrs
Mitchele was standing nearby, and I kept thinking to myself that she has no idea how much I actually think about math
Some time in sixth grade, John Wuthridge started digging a hole
I immediately started helping him
We started making a ring, about ten inches in diameter
People kept coming up to us and asking what we were doing
John had a nice coarse way of dealing with them, telling them it's a hole and go away mind your own business
When the ring was done, we started digging inwards to make it a hole
That's when Mr Donovan told us to stop, because it was ok when it was just a ring, but now it's a hole and that's not ok
That was the first memory I have of John Wuthridge
Mr Donovan could be rather mean
Most of the time he was nice
If you were very careful and polite to him, he would be nice to you
On the first day of art class with him, Kirby addressed him (in a friendly manner) as "yo"
Mr Donovan didn't like that
He said when you address an adult, you call them "Mr or Mrs"
Kirby started to argue that we are all equal, he shouldn't have to use a special title when talking to someone else
Mr Donovan said emphatically no, adults have been around longer and so you must treat them with respect
He sent Kirby outside
Then he told us that we don't know anything and unless we realize that he'll send us out like he did Kirby
On the last day of art class, he got us all in a circle to share what we were doing for the summer
Every time someone said or did something he didn't quite like, he'd make them come sit next to him
He got quite a pile
At the end he told us that we are all young and clueless and we need to get that through our thick heads (his words)
I didn't much care for him
Problem is I didn't do anything about it
Had a been a more clear-thinking person, I would have liked to say, "Listen, Mr Donovan, you're making people upset and it's not going to benefit them
I think it's highly disrespectful to assert that some people are completely subordinate to others
I understand that you have reasons for saying this but that does not make the result any less antagonizing
I would appreciate it if you would calm down a bit
But I couldn't
I wouldn't have been able to phrase it right and I wouldn't have been able to stand up to his response
So there was no way I was going to do anything
But I was right
He really was antagonizing people, and someone should have told him to stop
Middle schoolers can see that kind of thing
They know when something isn't right
They are actually very perceptive
But they can't phrase it right, they can't argue, and they end up making the situation worse if they try
So what can you do
It seems that what everyone else should do is treat middle schoolers with extreme patience, try to see past the obnoxious things they say, and look for what they are really thinking
But people don't do that, and they won't
So kids that age have all these ideas and emotions trapped up inside themselves that adults simply refuse to listen to
What can you do when communication doesn't work
They followed all the rules, but the result still ends up being absurd
What's the deal
If you want a safe society, you have to tolerate that
This is a highschool
It's not like we're talking about the whole country
If the rules get broken now and then it's not like it's gonna kill people
I want you to do something about Ben
In general EKA looked to make as little disruption as possible, and KMFE generally lead to disruption
But this incident had been too much
KMFE started making provocative fliers and putting them up around the school anonymously
They were quickly taken down
He would stand up randomly and give speeches, and no one listened
EKA started to notice that KMFE was more like a fictional character than a real person
He confronted KMFE about it
KMFE explained: “I seem like a fictional character because I'm the only one here who's real
You live among ghosts
Can those people really be alive
He just knew he couldn't do it in the material world
So he headed to the graveyard
Vincetti
That was simply malicious
In fact it was upsetting how easy it was – all you had to do was leave a note, and it wrecked his life
Why can't you do something now
After all, it's not like people's lives depend on it
EKA realized that he would have to give up hoping for a miracle
Apparently KMFE had fought his last battles
After a few minutes he decided he'd rather not be easily discovered by people walking by, so he made his plan to go into a room on the second floor and wait for something to happen
He might try seeing the visitor in an hour or two if things stayed quiet
If you try to visualize this song in the setting of the story, you will find it clashes
The reason for choosing this song has to do with portraying Jeff's obsession
The angel is wearing black leather pants and a frilly shirt
She is playing a shiny black bass guitar
The sky is blue and orange
And she is playing “Smoke on the Water,” a song which does not appeal to the subtleties of the situation
These are not the cool and tempered colors of a fond daydream
These are the bright, neon glaring colors of an obsession
KMFE tried to get his attention by waving a banana around
He shoved a box over to EKA
A piece of cloth tied in a knot, some pipe cleaners, some scraps of paper, a stuffed animal (a fox with wings) a blown easter egg painted with irregular spots, some electrical tape, and at the bottom, hope
EKA shoved the box back to KMFE
I think Jeff actually wrote that story
There were some people standing around in front of a tree
The window had a black metal frame in a brick wall
Maybe I'll get lost in the wild
that the angels play with time
I think you'll meet someone under the willow tree
KMFE closed the box and left in the opposite direction
He said she was going to kill people and he said it in a mean way
The national guard is in Iraq now
He didn't say she shouldn't do it but he said she'd be killing people
AR got very upset
It's not clear whether TDCP's approval meant anything to her, but even if it didn't, he was being mean, and he was usually nice to her
She could imagine GL acting like that – because GL felt so strongly about her opinions it often drove her to act emotionally over little things – but TDCP was not that principled, even if he'd like to be
That was probably it, though
TDCP sort of wished he were more stubborn, and it distressed him that he lived life so practically despite trying to have all these impractical principles to live by
So he figured now that he was a pacifist he ought to make use of it – only he was out of practice
So it came across as mean
Anyway AR ended up changing her mind about the national guard
It wasn't because TDCP disapproved
But that might have played a role in her decision – because she felt sympathy for him
She didn't like to see a strong person beat up by his own ideals like that
It made him seem weak – that was disheartening
She had learned not to test a person's strength until you really have to
At breakfast Antonio dropped an entire pitcher of water into her lap
Really by accident
It wasn't that Antonio was that clumsy, he just wasn't a morning person
The first breakfast he tried to pour himself a glass of orange juice, missed the cup entirely, and poured orange juice all over himself and the table
He claimed he wasn't awake enough to see where the cup was
To get back at Antonio for the water pitcher, Ella poured salt and pepper on his head
Then she went back to the girls' side to change, and missed the rest of breakfast
Today was visitation day
First the girls' bunks went over to the boys' side
Cherokee was so unprepared, they just stood around kicking a soccer ball back and forth and talking
At some point George Bede said "let's have a drinking contest"
Then Adrian lectured everyone on how lame they all were
This was Ella's chance to get back at Antonio
Salt and pepper just didn't cut it
Antonio was in Mackinac (raise eyebrows)
When Ella went over Antonio was busy being pinned under an upturned wheelbarrow with everyone else jumping on it
She demanded they get off so she could beat him up
They were all like "awwww that's so cute
And he just ran away
He ran off the boys' side down a path into the woods, the one that leads towards the fireplace
Ella chased him and caught up to him as he was climbing up a tree
She started to climb up after him, but he fell out and got so badly hurt he couldn't walk
So Ella carried Antonio all the way to the infirmary
Now Antonio is pretty skinny but he's also kind of muscular, so Ella must have been really strong, but she was totally exhausted when they got there
The really nice nurse named Jane that everyone really liked took Antonio and asked Ella a lot of questions about what happened
Then Ella went back to visitation, now on the girls' side, and put makeup on some guys' faces
The girls' bunks are always way better organized for visitation
Really late that night Ella snuck out to go visit Antonio at the infirmary
When she got there Antonio was outside crouched against the wall shivering
Ella: Antonio what are you--
Antonio: Shhh
no
no
I
I
don't talk it--  Then Antonio shrieked and ran away
Ella yelled after him "Antoooniooo" and then lights turned on and Jane walked out
Jane: Oh my God, Ella, what's going on
Shouldn't you be in your bunk
Ella: Antonio just ran away
Jane: Which way did he run
Ella pointed towards the direction of the stream and the rope swing
Jane: Oh, I wouldn't worry too much
He won't get far
Ella: He's got a broken leg
Jane: Antonio's leg isn't broken
He was probably just trying to get you to carry him
Let me walk you back to your bunk
Next morning Antonio was at breakfast but he wouldn't talk to Ella, so Ella refused to talk to him
Later she had to go over to the boys' side anyway to get her mail (it kept getting mixed up and sent to the wrong side) so she went over to Mackinac to see if Antonio was there
He was sitting on his bed reading a catalog
Ella smirked at him
Ella: Leg not broken, I hear
Antonio: It was so
Ella: Jane told me it wasn't
Antonio: OK, last night, I was sleeping in the infirmary, and some time in the middle of the night I wake up, and she's sitting there staring at me with glowing eyes
Ella: Haha like a cat
Antonio: Ella, I'm serious I'm not joking
And I screamed and jumped back, and she clawed me, then I ran out of the infirmary
You can even look here
Antonio's arm had three deep red scratch marks running across it
They looked like they hadn't been washed, and the skin around them was turning red
Ella: And then I found you there
Antonio: And you made too much noise
Then I looked up and saw Jane's glowing eyes in the window, and I screamed and ran away
I was going to run into the bushes past the rope swing, but -- Antonio started shivering and he couldn't finish the sentence
Ella waited in silence for a minute and then Antonio continued
Antonio: Then I came back here
I haven't seen Jane since
I haven't told any of my counselors or Sue anything
I mean I can't just tell them Jane's some kind of a werecat
And I promise you my leg was broken, it just isn't now
Now whenever there's a mystery like this the person to talk to is Josh Laker
Antonio didn't want to let anyone else know because he was scared of Jane, but Ella went and found Josh in the barn
Josh: I really shouldn't tell you this, but you know too much all ready, so I'm just going to give you the story, but then you have to keep quiet about it
Jane is a feature of the environment
She's a ghost
She's haunted Onas since before this camp existed
Ella: If she's a ghost what's she doing in the infirmary then
Josh: Sue's got Jane working there as a nurse so we can all keep an eye on her
We don't want to repeat anything that's happened before
The camp would get shut down and
other bad stuff
But Jane still has bad moments
Antonio woke up at a bad time, so you've got to tell Antonio to keep quiet too
If you do that, I'll tell Jane she doesn't have to worry about you two
Ella found Antonio at lunch but she couldn't talk to him around so many people
So she flicked peas at him with her spoon and started a food fight
His scar was looking even worse
After lunch she walked back to Mackinac with Antonio and told him what Josh had said
Next morning Ella found scratch marks on her blankets
At breakfast Antonio wasn't there
Josh Laker found Ella and said out of the corner of his mouth Josh: Someone is trying to send you a message
Ella: Where's Antonio
Josh: Gone
Find me before capture the flag
Ella didn't talk the entire day
She didn't have anyone to fight with at breakfast or lunch, so she just looked down at her plate and sulked
Before capture the flag she went over to the boys' side to find Josh Laker
Josh: Sue is going to try to get rid of Jane today
You have to get out or you'll get hurt
When we start playing capture the flag I want you to run down the driveway to the road and don't stop running until you get to Frenchtown
Ella: What happened to Antonio
Josh: I really don't know
If you want to be safe, you have to not worry about Antonio
Ella kept worrying about Antonio
While she was waiting for Capture the Flag to start she went over to Mackinac and saw that Antonio's sheets were bloody
That might be just from his scar
Nobody knows if Ella actually ran away like Josh told her to
If she went looking for Antonio, perhaps into the bushes past the rope swing, Jane would have certainly caught her and devoured her
Even if she did run to the driveway it's not certain she could have made it
What is certain is that Ella never made it out of Onas
We can also assume that Sue could never get rid of Jane
Jane is a feature of the environment
If Sue could have gotten rid of her she would have done it already
We also know that Antonio never made it home
If Jane had killed Ella and Antonio to keep people from finding out about her, she almost succeeded, except that Josh Laker's too good a story teller
He made sure the story got out, just that people would think it's a ghost story
If he told them it's real, they'd never believe it
Now they believe it just enough to be careful
He was boring
RK: Well you don't have to show it and anyway it seemed childish
KMFE: Are you saying I should be dishonest about my own feelings
RK: Yes, KMFE, I am saying that
You should pay attention to David so that he gets the impression that he actually matters to us, which in fact he does, even if it's in a boring way
KMFE: Why do business relationships always have to be so personal
RK: It's not personal, it's just polite enough so we don't all kill each other
You can at least pretend you understand that for thirty minutes
Neither of them were really upset, but arguing was as good a form of conversation as any
On the bus they didn't talk, then RK got off at her stop and KMFE two stops later
Then KMFE went to the dining hall
He was grateful to see Andrew because it decided for him where to sit
Cory was not there, and Andrew gave no indication that he was on his way
KMFE hoped Andrew wouldn't feel awkward after their last conversation
But Andrew was listening to music and not saying anything
Ten minutes later Andrew took off his headphones
Andrew: Aw what the heck you're here I'll be polite and not listen to music KMFE: All right Andrew: Did you check out the comic I told you about
KMFE: Umm
no I forgot
Andrew: Aw you should read it
It's quite good
Darn it, I can feel my stomach getting upset
I have the weakest stomach of anyone I know
KMFE: That sucks Andrew: Eh it's not that bad I just have to be really careful what I eat
An explanation of a sentence
Starring KMFE
KMFE: Well, first some background
It's from the time when I jumped into the stream and :P makes fun of me
Let's look at that exchange again: KMFE crawled onto the bank
The bottom of the river was very silty and now he was very muddy
See you're boring me already
He'd do anything if he thought it would make her laugh
I think some of the confusion is that here I'm using "real" more to mean "important"
In other words, :P doesn't realize that what she might mean as a joke is something that affects me deeply
Jo: So why did you put that sentence in your signature
KMFE: Mostly because it sounds cool
But I think it's applicable to many situations
People don't realize how much what they do and say matters to other people
That other people actually notice and think about them
Also, it's a general response to PL
I don't mean to complain about her too much, but she used to play with people's lives in a mean and condescending way
And it was real for them
But for her it was just a game
And she didn't realize how much damage she could do that way
Because she thought it was all just funny
Now if you asked her, she'd say it doesn't matter, really
That she'd have affected them whether it was deliberate or not
The best I can give is that one sentence reply
Jo: If it's mostly about PL, why did you say it to :P
KMFE: Well, first, I didn't actually say it out loud to :P
Because I still enjoy :P's company enough to overlook a few painful jokes
But also it applies to many people
I think everyone, really
Everyone exists as a real person in other people's minds
Jo: So do you want people to think about that
KMFE: Yes
I do
For their own sake and for others
For their own sake because a lot of people seem to think pretty low of themselves, and don't realize how much other people actually respect them
And for others' sake because it would be nice not to play games on vulnerable people
I was the evil supervillian programmer
I wrote a program to log in to GMail with the following goal
The program logs in as A, and the user specifies two other people B and C
Anything B says to A gets sent to C, anything C says to A gets sent to B
Now B and C both think they're talking to A, but are really talking to each other
My evil girlfriend cooperated
On the night of prom, the program logged into her account, and chose as victims my cousin DI who lives in Massachusetts, and Ben, who goes to my high school
I was a junior, PL was a senior, and I was going to her senior prom
Ben was also a senior, and he was going to prom with some girl not from our school
Dave was a junior
So they start talking to each other, and they both think they're talking to PL
Ben starts complaining how he doesn't have a way to get to prom
DI is very unsympathetic ("teleport
See Ben was going to go in a limo with Kevin (the cello player with the awesome forearms), but because it was Kevin's girlfriend's birthday, his mom told him not to be nice to too many other people, so that she feels special
So now Ben was stuck
And Ben was saying maybe he didn't even want to go
He wasn't feeling good about it
It was like he was just going to get it over with
And it was too bad because before he was looking forward to it
This is a guy who was desperately nerdy, yet for some reason wanted to be part of a social circle of 'cool' people, and spent a lot of effort sucking up to some people to get invited to parties
Personally I don't think it fit him - I always imagined him more like me, the antisocial type who wouldn't be going to prom anyway if he didn't have a girlfriend
And DI starts saying how he's not going to prom
He's got no one to go with
What about KMFE
KMFE's in another state
How did that happen
I don't know
Now DI thinks that PL knew perfectly well why KMFE is in another state, and that it's a deeper question of why his family moved so far from everyone else, why it means he can't see the rest of us so often, so he's kind of cut off, in a way
He's gotten into the same somber thought process as Ben
At prom PL and I were there, and Ben saw us
I don't know how he took it, I didn't talk with him
He never said anything bitter to PL
But there's something evil in it there, because being tricked into thinking gloomy thoughts, or really honest thoughts - that's the key - is embarrassing
Honesty is weakness
It sounds like you were just a jerk
KMFE: Well, evil's bad, isn't it
I don't think it's right to think of an evil person as this sexy superhero
As far as I can tell anyone who can cause malice for entertainment fits the profile
Jo: I suppose that makes sense; and you did use technical skills to accomplish it
But it's not the same as Lex Luther
KMFE: LOF, keep an eye on the program
Greg
Greg: Yeah
KMFE: There was a knock at the door, I'm going to go answer it
Any luck on the simulation
Greg: If by luck you mean running at all, no
Jo was at the door
KMFE: OK I have a few questions, among them how did you know I was hear, does anyone else know, and do you realize what a huge risk you're taking
But I'm guessing you have something more urgent to tell me
Jo: Who else is with you
KMFE: LOF and Greg; you don't know them
Jo: Are they known
KMFE: What
Jo: Does anyone know that they're involved in the Revolution
KMFE: I don't think so
But I didn't think anyone knew we were here
Jo: All right, good
I assume you're working on something important but I'm going to have to mess that up
KMFE, you come with me, and hurry
Tell Greg and LOF to get out of town fast
You take anything incriminating with you cause you're already a target
KMFE: Ask questions later
Jo: Sorry, I'll explain once we're in the next town
KMFE ran back to Greg and LOF
KMFE: OK, guys, I'm sorry to spring an emergency on you but you probably expected that anyway
You guys have to pack up and skip town for awhile; don't take anything with you
Greg: Abandon Alan's stuff
KMFE: I'll take the harddisk and the the floppy with the code
I don't know if I'll ever get a chance to look at them again
I don't know what's going on
Greg: Got it
LOF
My car's here
You coming with me
LOF: Yes just give me a second to make sure I haven't left anything here
KMFE: Jo, how likely is it you think they'll come out here
Jo: I'd say they're on their way now
What have you got there
KMFE: Harddisk from Alan
Jo: OK I don't know what that is, but I'll trust you need to take it
Now don't ask me -- yet -- how I'm involved, but I'll tell you later
All right, let's go
They hurried outside
KMFE: Do you have a car
Jo: No, we've got to run
KMFE: We'll stand out so obvious
Jo: Only for a little bit
KMFE's stomach hurt a little bit at that
KMFE: How'd she get involved
Jo: You told her where your notebook is
KMFE: We're gonna get into something far too complicated, aren't we
Jo: KMFE, you're probably right
You know more about :P than I do
But she promised to help and right now this is our only chance to get out
They got to the road bridge over the river and got onto the pedestrian walkway
There was a high fence on either side which might offer some concealment
Midway across they met :P
Hey, here's your notebook
KMFE: Hi :P
Uh, thanks
Jo: Well, :P, where do we go now
She stomped her foot on the walkway as if testing its strength
KMFE: Uh, you thinking of landing something heavy on here
The fence remained intact but sagged down more slowly to the water, with :P, Jo and KMFE clinging to it
Jo: Yes KMFE: Yes, I can
Now I think we'll float downstream, unless you guys have a better plan
Oh, KMFE, you did jump in the water
After about ten minutes, KMFE realized that they should have been caught by now
KMFE: :P, shouldn't emergency services be responding to the bridge by now
KMFE: The whole bridge collapsed
How did you do that
KMFE: Shut up, I wasn't talking about that
The bridge actually collapsed
I was not happy, and I wasn't in a good mental state
It was the end of summer, so I was sleeping at random times, usually staying up all night because I couldn't or wouldn't sleep
PL and I were fighting constantly
We were drifting further apart, I felt guilty and hurt
I was realizing in a huge stream all the ways she had tricked me
I lay awake all night
I was trying to sleep, but it just wasn't working
I still remember what I thought about, to try and calm myself to sleep
I tried to imagine where n was now, and I felt I was a bird flying to find her
It was a new, different thought
I had been isolated for a long time by PL, and forced to forget many things
I wasn't used to thinking about someone distant, not there, someone more a memory and a symbol than a person I could talk to
I wasn't used to this
I thought about n all night
When it got light out I got up
I played E7sus E7 Gma7 Fma7 on the electric keyboard, the song I remember from that day practicing with A Boy Named Earth in Kevin's house, that I have come to associate with n before the memory died
At that time the chords allowed me to recall the memory somewhat vividly, but that is the last time that happened
The memory of that practice had been a curious guilt, because it suggested some lack of faith in PL, but I was now trying to turn that guilt into something more like freedom
After all, I was losing faith in PL by the minute these days
I went outside for a walk
It was coldish, and somewhat misty
The ground was very wet
It felt like I was in a dream
That is also the last time I quite captured that sense
I knew today was the day n was leaving
I hadn't talked to her in a long time and knew that I would not talk to her for a long time, likely forever
I thought on and off about walking all the way to her house and visiting her one last time
She wouldn't like it
It was a long way to her house, and she'd probably be gone before I got there, if she wasn't gone now
I walked out to the bridge under construction, looked at it, and turned around
My left arm was feeling very cold, and I was very tired
I walked back on the other side of the road, often having to step over the guardrail into swampy overgrown areas to avoid cars
Then I saw the car that I will, despite the naivety of this thought, consider to be n
It was the same appearance, it had a bicycle on the back, which was plausible, it was heading roughly the right direction
At any rate, it was heading away from n's house
It could have been anyone
But I still say it was n
That lit up my soul
The downside was that now n was really gone
Hopewell was void of n completely
There was no chance of me seeing her again
But it meant that she was a part of my dream
That's all I ever wanted her to be, and that's all I lost through PL
Just let me dream about her
When I got back to my room, I talked to PL online
I told her I had a dream, but I could not share it with her
She had a way of ruining things just by listening to them, and I did not want to ruin my dream
But I had rediscovered n, and she could not ruin that anymore
This bothered her
She didn't want to hear about n
She didn't want to hear about any of the things that fascinated me now
I had a whole dream now, and she didn't like it
And that felt sad
Because I liked my dream
It's not a happy dream, it has no ending, it reveals nothing extraordinary
But it's an honest dream, and an optimistic dream, and I like it
That night I walked around Hopewell and considered deliberately the fact that n was now gone
I felt like I was walking in a different place
I would have to work on this dream
It was going to take time to build it back
First I had to give up on PL
I imagined that someday, when I had sorted things out, I would come back to her
Because I could not allow myself to give up entirely
I couldn't fail like that, or be so evil like that
But right now, I needed to build on this dream
Ghost: You're probably thinking that means I used to be living
KMFE: I actually didn't have any preconceptions
Ghost: You did, in the sense that if we both left, and you thought about it some more, you would think that I had once been living, and became a ghost when I died
You might call that just a potential preconception, but the information must be there to deduce it, so the distinction is immaterial
Like me
KMFE: So, would you like to explain how you happen to be a ghost
Ghost: Would you like to explain how you happen to be a human
KMFE: Because that's how I was born
Ghost: Well, no, not really
The concept of "you" doesn't mean anything until you are born, so then you're already human
There's no explanation for why you're human
There's no explanation for why I'm a ghost
KMFE: OK, let me ask the question differently
There are humans because humans beget more humans
Why are there ghosts
Ghost: Ah, that is a much better way of putting it
You would get the sense that a ghost is not the kind of thing that would evolve
But that's why it's equally unnatural for a ghost to be a dead animal
Animals were evolved -- they won't produce ghosts
KMFE: So, what is the reason
Ghost: There isn't one
KMFE: I'm afraid I don't find that convincing
Ghost: Why not
KMFE: Well, that's a good question
I guess I'm used to there being reasons for things
Ghost: Are you really
What's the reason today is Tuesday
KMFE: Um
I think it's just coincidence
Ghost: Isn't that another way of saying there is no reason
KMFE: Well, not entirely
I can't give you a reason why today in particular is Tuesday
But I could tell you why it could be Tuesday
Because some people a long time ago decided to create a cycle of days that included Tuesday, and people have been continuing the cycle ever since
And so I could go up and ask someone that they do indeed think today is Tuesday, so in that sense it is Tuesday
Ghost: OK, well what's the reason paint dries
KMFE: Increased entropy of water vapor as opposed to water in paint mixture
Ghost: So why does salt get wet
KMFE: Enthalpy of the attraction between salt and water
Ghost: It looks like the explanation doesn't even tell you anything
If water goes away, you say it's because of the entropy change, and if water comes in, it's because of the enthalpy change
That explanation will fit any data
KMFE: But those were two different explanations
Ghost: Yes but you chose them based on what actually happens
It looks like two explanations but it's one thought process
KMFE: But salt and paint are different
Salt is hygroscopic
Ghost: Meaning
KMFE: Um
meaning water collects on it
OK, but it has to do with the chemical properties of the salt
Ghost: Like the property of water collecting on it
KMFE: No, I mean the bonds and the particles
Salt is ionic, so it's hydrophilic
Ghost: Are all hydrophilic compounds hygroscopic
KMFE: Um
I don't think so
Ghost: so why salt in particular
KMFE: I don't know
But it has to do with the bonding
Ghost: Again, an explanation that will fit anything
KMFE: OK, you're right, I don't have an explanation for everything
But somebody has an explanation for why salt is hygroscopic
I could go look it up
Ghost: And if you pool all of human knowledge together, do they have an explanation for everything
KMFE: I guess probably not
Though if you consider that the physics of fundamental laws is fairly thorough, I suppose you could say everything follows from that
Ghost: And you imagine this is how nature works, with things following from each other
KMFE: Um
I don't know how nature works
I just still have trouble believing that you really can't give any information on why ghosts exist
Maybe I can't justify my suspicion, but that's the way it is
KMFE: No, that's not what bothered me
I don't care what her politics is
I just care when she says things that she can't really believe or hasn't thought through
Jo: Everyone says things they haven't thought through
KMFE: Yes, but it would be nice not to say things with conviction when you really have no clue
I mean I used to get really worried because she had all these really strong opinions about all kinds of things
And she'd act like it was just a really big deal and be really serious about it
And now you'd think that means she was maybe exaggerating or being sarcastic but I promise you that was not the case
Jo: That worried you
KMFE: Yeah, cause I though I might not stack up against all her criteria
And then finally I found out that she didn't honestly care about her opinions, or if she did care (and she could get very emotional, and legitimately angry or hurt, so maybe she did care) she could change her mind pretty quick
KMFE: But like, WHO DOES THAT
Why would you make it seem like you care about all these things that you don't actually care about
Especially if you like someone and want them to feel comfortable around you, why would you try to make it seem like you're always judging them
Jo: I guess she's not as Machiavellian as you often imply
KMFE: I don't really know what she was thinking
There's the official story
Jo: Yours or hers
KMFE: Um, both really
Probably mostly hers
It's that she was trying to warn me
But why she would warn me about things that don't matter instead of like things that do I don't get
KMFE: But about the socialist issue
So she had acquired the nickname "commie" for her CCCP teeshirt and in response she said something like "I would be like so in favor of communism if it weren't  completely against human nature"
And I really wish I had had the sense to say then "you have no clue what human nature is capable of
Really no goddamn clue
Jo: You can turn anything negative
KMFE: I can
It's so great
Actually, I can't, when the situation requires it
It's only later that I realize everything that was wrong about it
Then I get annoyed that I didn't think of it at the time
Jo: Well perhaps it's better that way
Same thing every time, and it's always understood that we are talking about that
So here's how it started
RE is very
sensitive, I guess
She takes a lot of things personally
Oh god don't tell her I said that
She'd – Ok I drop this topic now
But here's the point
Is she didn't take being overlooked well
So one time she is talking to me
And she starts telling a story
Very general
She explains that she does not want to admit weakness when she doesn't have to
She says I am like the science department
See, everyone has biases
Some people always get noticed more than others
Everyone will always worship these people, and they forget about RE, she says
She doesn't want fame
just
she doesn't like being overlooked
Especially when she's just as good as these certain other people
I tell her that there seem to be details here just beneath the surface
Of course I know exactly what she's talking about
I knew long before
Like months before, or at least I had some idea, and for at least a few weeks it's been obvious to me exactly who she is talking about
So I tell her a story
I say the same thing back
I apologize that I
well, might have had the same biases as the science department
And she gets it
That I knew what all her vague references were about
That I am like the science department
Jo telling a story to KMFE  It's so easy to make fun of communists
I'm not saying I'm a communist, but I think a lot of times people take advantage of the fact that communism is generally looked down upon in this country since the cold war, and they use it to make easy arguments
Anyway this distresses me because I think I get overlooked too
Not like RE, it's not a certain person
It's just that, the various left-leaning groups I've been involved with always have to watch where they step
Communism is such a strawman
And it's like people never notice what good is actually being done
Somehow it's become unacceptable to be good
Because that makes you a communist
Like SDS used to be my life
I felt very alive
Now I'm here and I just don't know
It's not that New CKRG is bad
It's that I can't get back the same story
SDS was a story
And I get in situations I never thought I'd be in
And that I don't want to imagine myself in
Maybe you can tell I'm a little drunk right now
I don't know I never drank before, before I got here
KMFE telling a story to Jo  It is kind of similar
But I'm coming from the other side
See Kaye is a very unreal place
I used to write these long emo stories about oh my god how come everyone here has all these made up problems why is there nothing real do you people even know what you are living for
I used to feel sick being in other people's houses and seeing the size of them
It's like, with D, I like you and all, but
how can we ever relate
It's like when people don't have any real, tangible problems they make up this fantasy world and get lost in it
But it's only inevitable that after a while, that starts to sink in
I hated it so much while I lived in Kaye, but now I miss it
I miss these unreal people
I can't find anyone here that can really be
fantastical
Of course RE was talking about :P
People like :P, so do I
It's all becoming a sort of dreamy boring epic
I'm writing it down, too
My world, the world I know from Kaye, that makes up most of my unconscious thought, is made up of these unreal stories like the science department
RE was very cold to me the next day
What does it matter
No it matters a lot
She was truly upset
But
it seems like the foundation isn't there
She didn't need to be upset
But that kind of story forms my mind
Sitting in the IDIA store it was impressive how much money these high school students had to spend on overpriced clothing
I was also impressed by how honestly these kids denied comprehending why we did not carry shirts reading "if you make a motion I'll extend my caucus
He tried to formulate the question for a long time while moving his mouth and hands awkwardly
After another few false starts he finally asked, "How are you both Asian and Hispanic
Later she asked me if I had a phone
Later when I was less tired it occurred to me that this was a very specific type of person to be: the type of person who wouldn't like phones, and I asked Craig how he figured you could identify that type of person
Craig didn't know but he suggested that a good game would be to make speculations like that about people
Craig and I were busy taping together 2940 paper clips into a chain mail blanket
The blanket was for a cardboard bed that in the end collapsed in front of the rest of the honors engineering class
The blanket looked cool though and many people offered to buy it
Right now it's in a big tangled mess under my bed
Gowri said someday we should try to untangle it and she'll hang it on her wall
My heart jumped at the phrase 'Owen and Tessa' but I had to tell her that actually I worked on it with Craig, not Tessa
Craig got to see my building when we were working on the project, and he said it seemed much more friendly than his building on Livingston, which to him was a "utilitarian dystopia
I had a long discussion about utilitarianism with someone who claimed to know Loan
He further claimed that he was really a Kantian bet spent the whole of our long debate making the case for utilitarianism
Is the case for utilitarianism scientific or philosophical
Is the notion that people maximize utility falsifiable, and does it need to be
He was using the argument to try to convince me to have a drink
I told him I knew I should, but preferred not to maximize utility
As I left I forgot to say "Tell Loan I said Hi
I looked west and it was very lit up – I'd never seen it like that before
Then the train went under the bridge and it was beautiful
I wonder if, were I down below on the tracks (as I have been many times before), would I have enough sense to get out of the way, or would I stand there watching the beautiful sight
Then to TDCP he said “I have all your fliers
Jo turned on the radio again
They were listening to a planet somewhere in the galaxy, and TDCP was acting as translator
KMFE: You mean like they talk in false statements instead of true ones
TDCP: Yes
Jo: So instead of “the cat choked on an eraser” it's “the cat did not choke on an eraser”
KMFE: But that's exactly the same
The two are isomorphic
It turned out that what TDCP meant is that they had “if, then” backwards, relative to the way we talk
But that was really just a word-order thing
So they made TDCP promise not to lead them on with things that sound interesting like that again
Jo: With people like us around, “they have true and false backwards” just sparks too much excitement
Later Jo admitted that not only would GL be unlikely to find the place, she hadn't even told GL where to look
This, she explained, was because she and GL were engaged in a rather malicious game, and it would have interfered
KMFE: So is GL looking for us
Jo: How could she
All she knows is that we're in a church
There could be hundreds of churches around here
Ten minutes later GL did show up
I don't know if it's encrypted, but it's hard to get at
We have a program to get at it, but this thing's some 40,000 lines of assembly, no function call conventions, no stack
Just one dense mess
On this floppy
LLF: Have you run it yet
KMFE: Yes, but here's the problem
This thing runs on the bare metal
80386SX, I was told
Could try it on a newer 386, but to avoid debugging ten things at once we got the real thing
LLF: Nice
Get that on Ebay
Greg: Of course not
This was in my attic
Dell 320N
Nice piece of brick
KMFE: LLF, the reason it's lucky Greg had one is that we can't communicate with anyone right now
That includes the internet
So we're stuck with the tools we've got
LLF: Was the code meant to be run on the 320N
Greg: I don't know
It seems to run OK
KMFE: Right, except for one thing
It randomly fails
LLF: ie it doesn't actually run OK
KMFE: Well, the puzzle is it fails in a different place each time
869 seconds, 1106 seconds, and 237 seconds
LLF: How do you know it fails
KMFE: The machine resets
LLF: How do you know that's not functional
KMFE: We don't
At least I don't
But I checked the floppy and it hasn't changed after a reset, so it would seem to be starting from the same parameters
LLF: How about the harddisk
KMFE: There is no harddisk in here
LLF: Does the 320N have any EEPROM or other persistent memory
KMFE: I don't know
That's the problem, dammit, we just don't know anything
Greg: Ah yes, it's "security by obscurity"
We all hate it and make fun of it, but it's a nasty thing to get around
LLF: There's a possibility you haven't considered
KMFE: I don't doubt that
LLF: Supposing Alan programmed a random failure into it on purpose, to make it take longer to get the data out
Run it enough times and eventually it will get to the end without failing
KMFE: That's assuming it's some kind of decay process
God knows where he gets the entropy for the random numbers
LLF: How much time do we have
KMFE: I don't know
The bill were in Philadelphia this morning
How long will it take for them to find us and get here
I have no clue
We've got four programmers and not one guy who knows something
Greg: But LLF, if Alan wanted it to take a long time, it would be so it would become readable after they'd searched his house but before they torched it
But an exponential decay process would have too much variability for that little window
LLF: Well we don't know it's a decay process, do we
Heck we don't even know it's random; in fact it would be easier for it not to be
I'm sure he could fake a decay process
Greg: How
LLF: I don't know I'm not a mathematician, but I bet it could be done
Greg: No, I mean, how is he getting the new seed each time in runs
In fact, even if it is a bug, something is still different each time
Which is starting to look like a hardware problem
KMFE: Well if we had any other hardware maybe we could deal with it
We don't even know we have the right machine
LLF: Wait KMFE, what did you mean there's no harddisk
Isn't the encrypted/obfuscated data on that harddisk
KMFE: Oh sorry, I meant no internal harddisk
This one's read only
And I checked it after a reset - no changes
Greg: Well something's changing
It might be as simple as running the floppy drive and timing it for the seed
But we're never going to be able to inspect this code
LLF: Is there an emulator for the 386SX
KMFE: I doubt it, and even if there is, we have no way of getting it
We can try it on a newer 386, though
Greg: Man, I wish we could have two of these running at once
First, because I want to see it fail a few more times and see what the distribution of running times looks like
Second, if LLF is right and the failure is intentional, then we might get lucky and it will work
KMFE: Well it needs to read it over the serial port
We only have one serial harddisk
I suppose we could try to simulate it on the newer PC
But the simulation would be a newer x86
LLF: Man, you guys, you don't have anything
KMFE: That's the problem with programmers
Everything's so easy to simulate on modern hardware
Put em in front of a real computer and they don't know what to do
LLF: But look, if you're going to try to simulate it, could you tweak it
KMFE: Tweak it how
LLF: Well, if it's reading from the harddisk over the serial port it knows something about the hardware
But we don't know anything about the hardware
If the 320N is wrong then we'll never get it right
So it may be our only option is to fiddle with the running environment
Greg: I can try to set something up in an emulator
But I wouldn't know where to begin 'tweaking'
LLF: Can you run it in a debugger
Greg: I don't see what use that would do
Can't do a stack trace with no stack, and we don't know where to begin looking at this code
KMFE: Well how much control do you have over the simulation
Greg: What specifically are you looking for
KMFE: Well, some processor instruction is ultimately causing a reset
And some other instructions are getting it there
Can you tweak the behavior of the simulated processor
Greg: I don't like where this is going
But
maybe
KMFE: Because we can't rewrite the whole code, or we wouldn't be in this position in the first place
But we could 'rewrite' parts of it in a sense, by changing the behavior of the hardware
And we could see what instructions are being executed right before the reset if we ran it through a debugger
LLF: How likely is it going to matter which x86 it runs on
KMFE: I honestly have no clue
I'm an applications programmer
What'll probably change are the IO addresses for various chunks of the hardware
Greg: Which would kill it outright, depending on how Alan wrote it
LLF: In other words we still have no clue what we're doing
KMFE: Dead on, LLF
Greg: All right, I'm going to set up a simulated i586
Let me know if you have any new ideas
KMFE: You might be interested to know it just failed at 632 seconds
LΟF: Which happens to be yet another multiple of 79
KMFE: Coincidence
LLF: If it's exponential with a time constant around 700 seconds, you'd almost never get a gcd as big as 79
It was probably warmer outside
I felt cold
Also darker outside
I was compelled to speak:  "My heart sometimes drifts back to her
but it seems once you add a couple hundred grand and the shadow of a life in prison, it doesn't leave room for much else, and so we sought to sign our farewells in each other's blood
But in the end it was another poor soul who took the knife and forced our reluctant peace
Ah well
I've had time to think
But things blur now
I'm not sure what's real and what's not
I think I'll go outside and count blades of grass
In his fictional world, things // approach a better state than they do in the // real world  // It is tempting to escape to KMFE's world, yet it  // IS NOT REAL
people are no so different: it is something common
It is displayed in many people
And yet it does not yet seem full enough to bring the world to anything good
What is it
It is not many things
And he made a rule that even if he was really stuck he shouldn't write about being stuck without anything to write about
And he kept this rule pretty well
But it got tempting
So he decided to break it just once, so that it wouldn't be tempting anymore and he could just write about normal stuff
Normal stuff, like that the refrigerator makes a noise like raindrops
As does the clock on the thermostat in the meeting house
He used to think that the thermostat sound was in fact rain
He would sit in meeting listening to it, because it is very repetitive
And it made him curious because it had such a regular rhythm to it
He started forming theories about how a drop would grow bigger as water ran into it, then drop off when it was big enough, giving a non-random pattern to the noise
Then John told him it was a clock and thus inherently cyclic
So
did that take all the fun out of it
No, not really
It took the mystery out of it
But that's not really bad
At least it doesn't bother KMFE
There's drunk people outside our window
Can you tell the people outside are drunk, or are they just being loud
There were people upstairs singing earlier
It's your turn to complain
KMFE: Oh this is delightful
You'd think I set you up to say that
KMFE: Of course I came here wanting to complain
First, because you will listen critical and not let yourself believe a word I say
KMFE: And second because I like complaining
KMFE: I discovered calculus towards the end of sophomore year in highschool
I figured most of it out myself
Which was immense fun
I have saved all my notes from that time
KMFE: Do you know that's the only thing I saved when it mattered
I didn't write down the emotional story of sophomore year
That is lost forever
But I got the math story
KMFE: It's interesting that this bothered PL
Not that I wrote it down (actually that did bother her later when I tried to share it), but that I would do calculus without taking the class
KMFE: She explained it was because of something ll did
He liked to learn a little bit of a lot of things -- she thought -- to appear smart
I think ll liked to learn things because he was curious and bored
But PL's allowed to make up stories about ll if she wants
Lord knows I do the same
KMFE: Of course I wanted to learn calculus because I like doing math
And it was fun to have something that I could figure out on my own
Mostly
And then it was fun months later finding out that most of it was right
The great thing about differentiation is its very possible for a tenth grader to do it, and for a huge variety of functions, and each one gives a special surprise
KMFE: Like when I struggled so long through E(x), and got E(x)
That was pretty cool
And then used that for ln(x) and got 1/x
Who would have thought
It was like it was designed to be pretty
Jo: Look, you told the story without complaining
I don't think you need to complain about PL
KMFE: That was just the backstory
The backstory is usually happy, before it gets ruined
KMFE: So months later, now I am in 11th grade, and PL was in calculus
KMFE: She had just learned about implicit differentiation
I still don't get how that works so well
But it's interesting
And she realized that this was a convenient tool for solving a lot of problems
KMFE: For example, to find the derivative of asin(x)
And she realized that memorizing a whole bunch of trig derivative formulas was pretty useless if you kept this method handy
KMFE: Now, I'm still working with my own calculus
I use a lot of personal notation, and haven't really adopted conventional ways of thinking about things
And PL used to be aggressive with math
KMFE: I tell her I have never heard of implicit differentiation, so she gives an example
KMFE: She tells me, say you want to find the derivative of sin(u) with respect to x
KMFE: Clueless, I say, I can't, I don't know what u is with respect to x
She says, yes, that's why the chain rule is useful
KMFE: Now let me digress to explain a difference in philosophy
PL thought of math as something you do
The chain rule is something you do to solve a problem
Differentiation is something you do
Sure, a function has a derivative, but it only matters when you go out and actually find it
KMFE: That way of thinking always made me uncomfortable
I'm not sure exactly why
I supposed it could have been just that I thought about math differently
KMFE: I thought of math as something that exists, and people can discover it if they play by certain rules
KMFE: But I didn't see much doing about it
It's there, it exists whether we choose to look or not
KMFE: But it feels that the discomfort went beyond just differing philosophy
KMFE: Anyway, I'm clueless, I don't see how the chain rule lets you solve the problem, I don't get implicit differentiation
But I had discovered, on my own, though not having checked it, that the derivative of inv(f), under the right circumstances, is 1/( inv(f)(f') )
So I suggest this as a solution to the problem
KMFE: I don't know if she followed, but she described my way as "more memorization", which was a negative
KMFE: Later I showed her that conversation and she laughed
She had stopped being aggressive with math
I don't know how she is now
KMFE: I remember this because something about her approach made me uncomfortable
I still don't know what it was
Perhaps it was just the aggression
A small set of stairs led up to a flat horizontal platform
David was standing at the foot of the stairs looking up
He'd have to climb up the stairs, then a ladder, then another ladder, just so he could get to where EKA and KMFE were
He could see them sitting on a cloud looking back down at him patiently
Actually EKA was sitting and looking patient; KMFE was trying to reach the telephone wire above his head
David tried to yell back and apologize for making them wait, but they could not hear him as far as he could tell
It looked like EKA was saying something but it was hard to see from so far away
Eventually David caught up, and he and EKA made a boost for KMFE to grab the wire
Once KMFE had climbed up he pulled EKA and David up
They crawled along the wire to one of the pulls that held it up
You could see a long way from here
KMFE asked if anyone felt tempted to jump
David said he had to admit it was a little tempting
EKA just said no
EKA suggested they climb back by the pole instead of going back to the platform
That should have been a good idea, since it should be much faster, but it turned out the pole had no bottom
It's surprising how long it takes to realize that
Because, you think to yourself "shouldn't we have reached the ground like hours ago
KMFE started the thought that maybe they never would reach the bottom
EKA and David didn't believe him until at least five hours had passed
Then they had to admit it did seem much more encouraging going back by the platform
When they got back to the spot in the wire above the platform, someone had moved the ladder
There was no way to jump here -- much too far
KMFE suggested they cut they wire and Tarzan down
EKA asked wouldn't they hit the pull going ridiculously fast, and David was scared just by the thought of cutting the wire
Well, maybe they could not actually break the wire, but cut a long piece from it -- like making it thinner -- and then use that piece to climb back to the platform
But how on earth were they going to cut the wire
This thing is thick -- and presumably under the insulation is some tough metal they're not getting through without tools
Well, maybe someone would take the ladder back
But if you can make a pole that goes all the way down and never ends, maybe you could wait till the end of time to give back a ladder
Actually, KMFE pointed out, it's completely plausible in the real world to never give back a ladder
EKA asked why that mattered, since the rules of the real world didn't seem to apply here anyway
KMFE said the rules of the real world are a useful language for describing their own violations
As John Smith walked northward down the ^Path at the end of the day,  he considered the event that had occurred today
Specifically, he considered the condition of a fellow employee of NKTC
That condition now included being permanently confined to a bed, and more significantly, permanently banned from awakening
The location of this unlucky person was now in a hospital south of the ^Hub
The air felt cold to John Smith
It had a feeling in it, but he could not define it
As he walked he thought, and when he did think some idea would inevitably form in his mind
He realized that thinking by itself was not an unpleasant activity
It was about the time he reached that conclusion that he reached the end of the ^Path
This led him along a road heading away from the sea
The air had put some thoughts into his mind, but they had also conjured an emotion
The emotion was new, and its unfamiliarity pleased John Smith, carefully covering itself with the world that surrounded
For no reason in particular, he did not use the electric lights that night, and lit candles instead
He lived alone so there was no one else to consider in this choice
He was glad that something felt different, and in the absence of an understanding of what it was, he augmented it
The sense of unfamiliarity wanted to go somewhere, but it was trapped, sustained in its prison by the light of the candles
There may have been a hope to draw something from it, but hope does not accomplish much
John Smith watched the sky from the window
All night until he fell asleep it looked as if a storm were approaching
The next morning he was woken by a cruel ray of sunlight shining directly into his face
um
AR
me: ~ahem~ me: Sorry if this
well
me: Sorry for my general social awkwardness, but I'll try not to be ambiguous here
me: What
are you doing tomorrow
me: As in
this is an attempt to ask you out
AR: Um
you know I'm already dating Jeff
AR: sort of
AR: As in
we have a date for saturday
AR: sorry
me: when did he ask you out
AR: yeah me: or the other way around
AR: he asked me out
AR: And that was two days ago
no three
monday
AR: He didn't tell you
me: no
me: OK
me: I'm going to go
outside now, I think me: that's cool you and jeff are going out
Hope you have fun saturday AR: no stay
AR: you feel sad don't you
me: OK, if you want I'll stay
me: well of course I feel sad, but it's well, like, just entirely my fault
I mean, maybe things will be a little awkward with Jeff, but, yeah
AR: :( I'm sorry me: eh me: don't worry about it AR: because I mean to be honest, it's not like I'd rather be going out with Jeff than you AR: if like, after saturday AR: I change my mind
me: AR, I would always be happy to see you AR: OK AR: but AR: dammit AR: so
AR: if I
AR: I kind of
hooked up with Jeff AR: already me:
AR: I kind of thought he'd tell you  Sometimes I think jealousy is a vague abstract feeling
But these times I know it's real
It's the worst feeling imaginable
I can feel it in my arms
Jeff came over the next day
Soon as he walked into my room I grabbed him and hugged him
Not to tell him anything, but because, even now, he's still someone I trust
Trust to understand me when something's upsetting me
I held him for a long time
me: OK, most of the time this would be to tease you or annoy you, but not this time
me: And it's not that I realized I'm gay and am now aggressively flirting with you
me: AR
told me something
Last night
Jeff: Are you upset that I didn't tell you
me: No
at least if I find out from her I get to talk to her
I gave him a weak grin
Jeff: I was going to tell you
Jeff: But then I decided to wait until I see you
Jeff: Otherwise you might think I'm just screwing with you
Jeff: (Instead of her)
Jeff: Sorry that was sort of a jerk thing to say
me: You know, it's playing out just like 12th grade
That was an emotionally tough time, but it wasn't a bad time, overall
It was a time I was very alive
And I've never felt so alive since
me: Only problem is you're doing Vex
Jeff: I could not
Jeff: I was only doing it because it looked sort of fun, and because you're doing it, and because I need to get off my lazy ass and actually do something this semester
me: I would feel completely awful asking you to not do Vex
Jeff: Isn't that what you basically just did
Jeff: You said "only problem is you're doing Vex"
If it's a problem, that implies you don't want me to do it
me: Um, no, I meant to imply it digresses from the pattern of 12th grade
So we'll see what happens
AR had been meaning to visit my suite for a long time but it hadn't happened yet
Just never got around to it
This Sunday she actually had time and came over
AR: That's a nice rug
me: Yeah, that's Cody's
He was way more prepared than I was
It's really quite embarrassing
This is his light, too
And he put shelves in the bathroom
AR: You're room looks nice
me: I'm glad you like it
AR: But your wall is so empty
You don't have any posters or anything
me: I had the one from last April Fool's Day, but it's felt so it was too heavy and kept falling down
But I have a whiteboard that I can write on as I fall asleep
When she left I told her I was leaving too
me: I feel sort of upset, I guess, and running helps that a lot
AR: I'm really sorry
me: AR, it is not your fault
Whether you want to blame yourself is up to you, but I do not blame you for anything
In the stairwell she started yelling at me
AR: KMFE, you've got to stop it
AR: You try to act so noble all the time and say you don't blame me for anything but you're face  makes it look like you're about to cry
AR: You're just making me feel guilty and then making me feel even more guilty because you pretend to be so nice about it
Deon walked into the stairwell in time to hear that
He looked awkwardly up
Deon: I'm sorry guys, I didn't mean to violate your privacy
I didn't know you were having a discussion in here
me: It's OK, Deon, we were just walking through
It ended up like 12th grade
The way it should go
I oh so gradually stopped talking to AR
Focused on robotics
Stayed up all night programming
And it was wonderful
Things didn't go especially smooth between AR and Jeff
I always wondered whether that was partly my fault
I think the biggest reason, which Jeff thinks is the only reason, is that AR and Jeff never really understood what the other was saying
Jeff still wanted AR to be another AU, and AR
couldn't do that
And then of course I could never hear the full story from Jeff
Because it's the story I wanted to write
And I just
am too petty to let someone else write it for me
He had lost something
Somehow he thought there was another way the story could be captured
You have to do it candidly, because you never know when something new is going to turn up
If you want to get the sense of discovery, you have to have started recording by the time it's happening
You have to take in a whole flood of boring and irrelevant details, and maybe somewhere in there you'll get the story
And then you have to sift it out
He knew it would be hard, and tedious, and all the time rather boring to get at the story this way
But after his encounter with the visitor he decided that it was his duty
Jo flew back to Newark and :P to BWI
As they were waiting together by the gates, Jo had some sense of why KMFE treated :P with such suspicion
This person she had met a few times before had showed up, not knowing where KMFE was (Jo had had to figure that out) but knowing what to do, had swiftly flown in to move KMFE to a safer spot, and was now heading off again without ever telling the full story
Jo was not as confused as KMFE, because she had known people like :P before
That time at her old home in Louisiana, when Jo and her mother needed to leave in a hurry, and the gates had been closed for the night, Jo's brother had shown up as if out of nowhere (so it had seemed to Jo at the time
Her mother might know how he got there)
He showed them how to get around the gates without setting off the alarm, and when they were out he left just as quickly
Because of that incident, and because of the time Jo had almost drowned but her brother stumbled across her by accident and saved her, and because he was so much older than Jo and she almost never saw him, Jo had come to see CMS as a sort of angel who would appear at a time of crisis
That's what made it tough to learn that he had been arrested and jailed for possession of a large assortment of assault weapons
How could an angel let himself get caught
It was unclear to Jo what obligation :P felt to help KMFE, but she did not find this mysterious
There are many reasons a person might have for helping someone else
KMFE should feel lucky that he still had an angel watching over him
Of course that might be what he resented
Especially after PL, who sounded at times like a formidable protector
PL had gone a step further to manipulate KMFE in ways he now resented
It was natural to worry :P might do the same
But :P was most of the time disappeared, out of KMFE's life except for a few episodes
John Smith carried two things of significance
The first was a messily compiled list of the present plans of the ITA
The second was a letter to the chief council of NKTC accepting the offer for a meeting to discuss ITA's relationship with the company
Neither of these was the focus of his thoughts, which were at that moment occupied with a vague sense of purpose
The purpose was unclear, but the sense of it was present and certain
He was walking southward along the  ^Path
The hour ensured the lack of other traffic beside him
The three of them were no more than John Smith and the two papers
That the path curved around so many buildings at those parts where it was not hanging over the water was not as disconcerting to John Smith now as it often was
The whole path was simply an obstacle now, not a challenge or a symbol
He glanced to his left but the sea was to his right
He did not look upwards, as he never had
Of John Smith's two possessions, 6758 knew only of the second
Her knowledge of it was a compelling factor in her appearance on the ^Path at this time
John Smith did not immediately recognize her
Her face was mostly obscured by a hood, of which, had someone asked, she would have explained as being for her own confidence, but no one asked, and so the detail remained unstated
When he did recognize her, his greeting was obscured by his own thoughts, which were not for his own confidence, although he might have been pleased if they were
She appeared very different than when he had last seen her
She now sat in a wheelchair, on the side of which she leaned in a manner that was very subtly sarcastic
The ^Path might have formed no straight lines if not that its components required it
The sea was still to John Smith's right
Do you remember why I left
I would actually like to hear you say it
They had been built at too many different times
He avoided his immediate thought
Really silly of them; you were one of the better workers on our floor
You know, I was inspired by that first attempt
It failed miserably
Hope I will never see again
You really have become such a fool
You lead a life of complacency, and it doesn't bother you
It's working - here," he began to reach for the first letter
6758 interrupted:  "The Intent To Act
It was perhaps the closest you ever came to actually doing something
It could have been such a beautiful path out of the world's leaden spirit
You lost the path
You destroyed me
It's not just a simple job for another transportation corporation
It really isn't
Look at me
That the whole of humanity is no better than they ever will be
The hope of the ITA was lost, and sometimes it seems it never was hope at all
I have become so much less than I ever was, and I was nothing to begin with
I am not as weak as I pretend to be
I have power still, nothing great, but the power that is given to every person
John Smith, I shall not let you pass
He began to move, not certain if he would like to approach or retreat
As he did so she stood up out of the wheelchair and moved toward him
Unsure of what he or she was doing, he reached for his third, and until now unthought of companion, the seal of his paranoia, the knife
He did not have time to feel foolish for not knowing how to fight with a knife before she lunged at him and grabbed it
As they fell over towards the sea-edge he reached his hands for her neck
Unable to achieve one final gasp of air to assist her failing strength, she thrust the knife into his chest
The noise alerted a nearby police officer
He saw them a few hundred feet down the ^Path and ran to them
It did not take him long to confirm they were both very dead
Here's a question (Jeff says I've gotten good at asking questions)
I have the impression that things in my life are much more mechanical and much less emotional than they used to be
I think of the things that have happened to me today, and I cannot imagine that I would want to read them in three years (that's about how far my outlook goes -- makes sense if you think it was -- no it was even more than three years ago that I lost
That's scary)
So, is that true
Or is it that I don't know what's important until long after it's happened
Maybe I should throw in the mechanical things, because someone, they might just matter
From the math department's website: Math 421 vs
Math 423: A comparison  These two courses are only superficially similar: 421 serves to introduce techniques needed by the Mechanical Engineering program while 423 is an introduction to the mathematics of partial differential equations
So I was thinking of taking one of these two classes
I'd really rather take 423
AR asked me was I going to take "Calc V" next semester and I said probably yes
She said she planned to also
I thought "sweet"
But she's probably going to take 421
And I don't want to
And now I don't think I really want to take 423 so much either
Though
maybe
But
I feel like I shouldn't take classes with the aim of learning things, because that's just not how it happens
I never used to do that, and it worked fine, so I shouldn't get into the habit now
Better to take the classes I have to and learn what I want to
Jen offered to mention me to AR in an encouraging way
I told her I think AR has a boyfriend (I think she does, but I'm not even sure)
She said "that can be dealt with"
Any temptation I really did feel at that time is a false hope
I love AR (as much as Jeff hates her), but
no
Though I still feel guilty for being tempted
And I haven't talked to AR in so long
it was in CS113 Rhombus guy was talking to another student about CS205
Rhombus: It's just a math class
Crypto had not been paying attention before
He turned around and delivered one quick smug sentence to Rhombus guy
Crypto: No, it's not math
Rhombus: It is so math
I took it last semester
Crypto had to turn back around to continue the argument
He picked a facial expression that would show Rhombus guy how worthless this little discussion was to all that was CS
Crypto: No, it's not math
He added more emphasis this time
Crypto: I'm doing honors in math
CS205 is what they tell you is math, but it's not really
Rhombus: Have you taken 205
Crypto: No, but my brother did, and I taught him 205 when I was in 11th grade
It's not math
Rhombus: Dude my dad used to work as a mathematician, as a job
I know what math is
Crypto wasn't going to participate any further
He just shook his head and turned away
Rhombus: I'll admit that it may not be math as you do it in honors in math, but it is math
Just like arithmetic is math
Crypto: No, it's not math
It's just numbers
Rhombus: OK, it is numbers, but it is also math
Don't you think everyone should be allowed to appreciate math
Rhombus turned around looking for support
Rhombus: He must be a math elitist
Sad
Sesh tried to make the lecture interesting by giving his power-point slides witty titles
He was right that the lecture needed some spicing up
After months of doing vague, elusive "design" projects in Java, we were starting C
To learn as a language, nothing more
Sesh put some code up on the screen
The fonts were way too small to read
People started complaining
Somewhat as a joke, he decreased the screen resolution to 800x600
The code he was putting up was included in the slideshow as an image, which power-point helpfully kept scaled to fit the screen size
The text was still too small to read but now it was a little blurrier from the up and down scaling
Everyone said it looked a little better now
Rhombus guy held his hand to his chin thoughtfully as Sesh started explaining the code
Halfway through he interrupted
Rhombus: hhhhmmmmmmmmmm
Sesh gave him a dark look
Sesh: Do you have a question about it
Rhombus: hmmm
I guess it's all right
Sesh pretended nothing had happened and kept going
Someone in the back of the room asked if you could do multithreading in assembly
Sesh: I guess you must be able to
I mean ultimately it all turns in to assembly
Someone else made a comment about C++, and one of the Yuris brought up C#
Sesh tried to dodge the distractions
Korose grew out of collective economic interests
They were sort of a trade bloc
But now they don't seem concerned about the economy at all, and they have become very secretive
It was a really big deal when they first decided to make the leadership secret
They wanted to keep it accountable
Actually, before that, it was barely accountable at all
But they had to counter the image of secrecy
Problem is you can't elect leaders if nobody knows their identity
Even if people could cast votes they wouldn't be able to make an informed decision
So what they did is they have member planets elect a body, let's call it the Assembly, and the Assembly picks, secretly, the top leadership
AR: You mean it's not really called the Assembly
KMFE: Well it doesn't really have an English name
Actually they eventually figured out that the ONLY universal way to name things is with numbers
Because not every culture has written or spoken symbols, but most can at least learn to count
You can't communicate complex ideas this way, but you can give things names
The Assembly is 54126520
People have attempted to make a number-based system of communication, to deal with the vastly different languages that cultures have developed
So think about it -- every culture on earth -- at least I think so -- has spoken language of some form
And roughly in the same frequency range
Even so, the types of sounds and the grammatical structure differ vastly
But still, we're all human, we all live on the same planet, and the underlying ideas are not too different
But on the galactic scale that's all gone
About 70% of planets use auditory language
Of those, about 2% use the frequency range we do
A tiny fraction of those use sounds that would be intelligible to us
Of the ones that we could interpret the words themselves, the grammar would be unrecognizable
If we could get past that we would have very little vocabulary in common because we'd be talking about very different things
But trade at least creates a common set of things to talk about
So the idea is to give every relevant concept a number
For example, you could give iron the number 20, gold 26, lead 534, etc
Then you'd have numbers represent levels of purity, the shape, units for size and mass and volume
Then you'd have numbers for actions like melting and grinding and moving and exchanging
You put all these in a massive dictionary, and you get one guy to translate that dictionary for the local language
Then the trading parties can just exchange numbers and don't need a translator
AR: Is there a universal way of communicating numbers
KMFE: Ah, that's another problem
For small numbers you just count
But eventually that gets time consuming
And the issue with these numbers is you have to get them exact, because they have discrete meanings
Actually, the dictionary is designed in such a way that nearby numbers have vastly different meanings, so that if there's an error it's more likely to catch it
Now you'd probably expect that not every planet uses positional notation like we do
But eventually they decided that that was the only way to reliably communicate vastly different numbers with perfect accuracy
They used base 2 for simplicity
But the good thing about numbers is, if you don't have a way to reliably communicate base 2, or if you want to use another way for some reason, it makes no difference, because you're just dealing with numbers
Anyway, that's beside the point
So the Assembly has no real power
They can't make any decisions other than to chose the Leadership, and then they periodically decide whether to replace leaders
They are permitted, according to the constitution, to remove any leader any time by unanimous vote
This gives people some trust that the Leadership will be accountable
But it didn't start out anything like that
The Korose movement really began in a series of decently hospitable solar systems called the Ketting clusters
They were colonized in sequence, so they had relative uniformity of culture and language
This led to extensive trade
Ketting 25 became a center for trade among all the other clusters and many planets outside of Ketting
Now, you need to see why trade would matter to the Ketting clusters
Trade matters to us as a nation, but if WWIII came around, we could, with enough pain and suffering, be self-sufficient
This is not true of colonized planets
Life did not evolve there, and is able to exist only through trade
It is still profitable to colonize because the new planets have natural resources, and provide a site for industry
But the economy of a colonized planet tends to be highly specialized, and would be worthless without a market for export
Planets where life evolved are therefore special, because if trade were interrupted by war, they can still survive
That means those planets have the option of starting wars
This gives them significant power
As trade became more important and involved more planets, an increasing percentage were planets outside of Ketting
This meant differences in language, culture, laws and such things
Trade thrives on uniformity, so a private group on Ketting 25 called Korose started up to address the issue
They were not sovereign in any way
This is important, because it's vastly different from how they operate now
They didn't even have the sanction of the 25 government
They were a private corporation
What they did is they allowed planets to join their organization if the planets met certain standards
They created the number-based language, uniform system of measurement, protocols for transporting and exchanging goods
Banks on Ketting 25 had effectively created a currency by loaning shares of major corporations
Korose created standards for lending practices, required banks to hold 8% reserves (this seems high by our standards, but on a galactic scale things are very uncertain and you need a big cushion -- especially since they didn't have the power to make an analog to the FDIC)
Again, banks joined completely voluntarily, but being a member of Korose conferred such tremendous trust by other parties that it became almost mandatory
Then they dealt with legal issues
Laws differed so much from planet to planet that merchants kept getting arrested
There was a tendency to trade only along established patterns, because anything else was too risky
So Korose figured out a protocol by which merchants could enter and leave planets without fear of arrest, and so that the host planet could verify that the incoming merchant was a member of Korose
That's when Korose started taking on a judicial role
They required members to send complaints first to a Korose official for arbitration
This helped matters immensely, because it meant that merchant ships wouldn't be shot out of the sky for a minor breach of protocol, and it eliminated all kinds of opportunistic violence
All this time Korose had been leaving the basic structure of member planets in place
They weren't trying to change anything major, just create a common interface for trade
But it's a timeless fact that although trade is powerful, war can crush it in a heartbeat
There was a particularly miserable war in which Ketting 23 was destroyed entirely and Ketting 25 received massive damage
The loss to hundreds of publicly traded corporations wreaked havoc on the ad-hoc currency that Korose members had been using, and effectively shut down trade in most of non-Ketting Korose for about 15 earth years
Now as I said before, a lot of the planets in Korose were colonized, and colonized planets cannot survive without trade
Definitely not for 15 years
Hundreds of planets were abandoned or exterminated
The death toll is hard to define accurately, since it's not always clear how much is a single organism, but it would probably be something in the trillions by most counts
AR: Oh my god
That's horrible
KMFE: When trade crept back, it centered around planets with evolved life
Those same planets had also been the chief perpetrators in the war
So Korose realized that another condition for trade was impeccable prevention of conflict
This was a tricky issue for them
They had new rules that they wanted to introduce, but that would mean kicking out members that didn't accept them
That could wreck their economies, and seemed to be a violation of the trust the members placed in Korose when joining
What they eventually realized, though, is that the new restrictions were inevitable
If Korose failed to adopt them, there were already thousands of planets that either already met the rules or would be willing to adopt them
Some day these planets were bound to form their own group, which would be more powerful than Korose on account of the new rules, and eventually replace it
So the least destructive option was to introduce the new restrictions through Korose's existing framework
The plan was to eliminate the ability of member planets to wage war
They would approach this in several ways
The first was to require a certain system of government, which happened to be of a democratic form
The reasoning was that since individuals on the planet benefit personally from trade and from membership in Korose, that if the government were in the hands of the people they would be less likely to jeopardize those benefits
Now you can see just from earth that that is clearly not enough
And Korose had examples of their own
So in addition to requiring a democratic government they banned military power completely
If we tried to do this on earth, we'd run into a heavy argument about self-defense
Korose didn't have to deal with that argument
First, rhetoric doesn't get you very far when no one even speaks in the same frequency band as you
Second, Korose could rely on the allure of trade to convince skeptical planets
And they were pretty sure, after the experience of the past 15 years, that military power rarely, if ever, served an advantageous role as self-defense
Since many of the original Korose employees had been killed in the war, they decided that in order for the Korose framework to be durable the top leaders had to be protected
This is when they made the decision to make the Leadership secret
To keep a good impression they created the Assembly and started holding elections
The Assembly would be given full authority to decide how many members in the Leadership, and who those members are
But the Assembly would not have any power to make or enforce rules
Now these must have been huge elections
There were, at the time, about 5000 planets in Korose
You can't do a per-organism vote
So they did a per-planet vote
Once the first Assembly was chosen, the Assembly, in secret, picked the first Leadership
The Leadership then set about writing the new rules
Up until this point Korose had no enforcement power
If a planet broke the rules, they would be kicked out of Korose
But people realized that for self-sufficient planets, that wasn't enough incentive
They had to find a way to take away a planet's option to screw everything up and then just leave Korose
But no one would trust the Leadership with actual force
The surest way to start another war would be to get together a military
So the Leadership made a rule that limited the number of law enforcers that could be together in a region of the galaxy
That's why our force here is so small
The local police could take us all out if they wanted to
Of course they don't know that, and they're not part of Korose so no one told them the rules
But they could, and that's what's important
And if the Leadership's police ever got out of hand, any bunch of vigilantes with pickaxes could take them out
That's how the Leadership started doing secret things
They had so little force, but they had information and influence all over the galaxy
So they could act strategically
They had to, it was the only way they could do anything
So nobody has a clue why they're here on Earth
Not even these guys here
The Leadership knows, but they won't tell anyone
They might tell the Assembly, but probably not, and if the Assembly did know they probably wouldn't tell anyone else
They only thing that's obvious is they don't want Kereol taking control of Earth
AR: If Kereol took control, what would they do
KMFE: I don't know
Kereol is also very secretive
It's possible they would loot it for natural resources, but the immense secrecy suggests to me that they have broader strategic goals
Looting non-Korose planets is technically legal, if you do it with no military force
AR: That guy from Kereol who shot all those people used force
KMFE: Ah, well it's possible that that was below the permitted limit
One gun isn't going to get a lot of people upset
Two might
But I don't know for sure that Korose would report them if they did have illegal weapons here
AR: What about Earth
Humans have enough explosives to blow up the whole planet
KMFE: Korose can't control what non-members do
I understand that Korose negotiators in Washington are trying to get the US to abandon its military
I don't know if they're making any progress
It's possible they want to bring Earth into Korose so it would be protected from Kereol
You see Korose has gotten into the habit of making exceptions
Technically Kereol should be kicked out
They have 152 planets, which, according to the rules should all have separate and independent governments, but in reality they are all under central authority
Also the elections were rigged
Korose suspected that the controlling Kereol party, let's call it Kerpat, would try and rig the election to maintain power
So Korose sent in election monitors
They agreed beforehand to a set of statistical tests to identify fudged results
You see statistical tests don't do much for you if you don't agree on them in advance
Problem is that means Kerpat knew exactly what the rules were
So they came up with the most ludicrously fabricated numbers, but tweaked them so they passed all the tests
AR: And people believed them
KMFE: Of course not
Kerpat intended it as a smudge on the election monitors
A way of telling them that they had no power
They designed the numbers to look as fake as possible, and the election monitors couldn't do a thing about it
It was really at Kerpat's option whether to even make them pass the tests or not
Even if the tests had showed a rigged election the monitors couldn't have done anything about it
AR: So Korose should have kicked them out
KMFE: They should have
But they didn't
And the reason is most likely because Kereol has a lot of self-sufficient planets, and they were worried that angering Kereol would lead to another war
So they decided to be very delicate about it, and just tweak things back into place
That, I suspect, is what they're doing here on Earth
AR: And what would happen to Earth if there was a war
KMFE: We'd be all set
We're a self-sufficient planet with more military power than all of Korose combined
Sure our space-travel is primitive, but we'd be fine for defending ourselves
The biggest risk is that we blow ourselves up
AR: And is that why Kereol wants Earth, because we're self-sufficient
KMFE: It's only self-sufficient if you can breath the air and drink the water
Kereol can't
If they wanted to make use of Earth they'd have to get humans on their side
Which they are showing no signs of doing
AR: So in summary, Kereol wants to loot Earth of its resources, and Korose doesn't want to let Kereol get too powerful so they're trying to protect Earth
KMFE: I would be careful about summarizing
Some things still don't stack up right
AR: Such as
KMFE: I would think that having humans on your side would be a big deal here
Since neither side is technically allowed to use force, this should be a majorly diplomatic fight
But Korose is doing everything covertly, and making it very hard for humans to tell what's going on
AR: Not to mention the violence
KMFE: Exactly
If Korose is trying to protect Earth, they're killing people at a curiously rapid pace
And there have been a lot of guns fired for a diplomatic operation
Either both sides seriously misunderestimate the potential for diplomacy, or, I don't know, something completely different is going on
AR: Well does Korose know it's possible to negotiate with humans
I mean Earth must seem a pretty fractured environment, politically speaking
How would you even know who to talk to
KMFE: Well, they figured out about Washington
Perhaps they don't realize that mass killing here in New Jersey might actually have some effect on the negotiations going on down in DC
But for people used to entire-planet government (since that's what Korose requires), you'd think they'd make the connection
AR: Unless they think Earth is just such a mess it doesn't matter what you do to it
KMFE: Ha, some humans even think that
I guess it's possible that they really are trying to get humans on their side, and they're just really bad at it
AR: So what would Korose have to do to get Earth to join
KMFE: Uh, well, convince them to
There's nothing stopping Earth from joining if they meet the requirements
AR: What would have to change
KMFE: Well, we'd have to get rid of all weapons
That would include all guns, anything remotely military, anything that carries a lot of combustible fuel, so that probable means cars, and definitely airplanes
AR: They'd never do that
KMFE: Right
So it's pretty much impossible
Also the Earth would have to have a planet-wide democratic government that would have to be more powerful than any subdivision, ie more powerful than any country
AR: Also not going to happen
KMFE: Right
So either Korose doesn't know anything about Earth, which is entirely possible, or they're not really trying to get Earth to join
AR: How would they learn about Earth
KMFE: I have no clue
The Authority is limited in physical force, but they are allowed to gather pretty much as much intelligence as they want
Doesn't mean they necessarily have the capability to do so, or the desire
So they might really be clueless
AR: So that's what gives the Authority power, then, is knowing everything that goes on, and being able to coordinate it
KMFE: Well, I'm not really clear on that point
The official answer is that the Authority has no power at all (remember it's still not a sovereign entity), and that people only listen to it by contract
But Earth has no contract with Korose, and Kereol seems to be in direct opposition to whatever Korose's doing here, so I am not inclined to believe the official answer
AR: And doesn't it hurt Korose's credibility, if they get involved with this kind of secretive thing
KMFE: Maybe nobody knows
No, that can't be true, because all Korose enforcement units are monitored publicly
So, "everybody" knows they're here
Um, I really have no idea
You'd think it wouldn't be so good
AR: A secretive operation that everybody knows about
KMFE: I
I
don't know
I really don't know
First I wanna explain why I ran off so fast in the dining hall today
So what you saw was me and Jeff walk up, I wave while Jeff screams "Tessa you're my favorite person ever
Leading up to that Jeff and I were talking about going to say hi to you
I told him I was going to wait until he left
But then he ended up following me
So the reason I wanted to wait until he was gone, was, well a few reasons
First, he has trouble accepting that I would actually just like to go talk to you, without trying to tell you something compelling or anything
Just talk to you, because I like you and I like talking to you
He always tells me "you should go confess your love for her"
I think
there's nothing to confess, really
If we can be friends and get along well, that's really all that's important
The other reason I wanted to wait until he left is he has way too much energy
And yells things like "you're my favorite person ever"
But anyway, he was there, and then we left together
So I could have gone back
But, well, you looked like you were having a peaceful lunch, and you were sitting with Lee, and
after Jeff yelling at you I just didn't want to go bother you more
Kind of makes me sad since I have no more classes today, you don't have classes for awhile
And I don't know when else I'll see you
Dammit, maybe I should just go back
I don't know
You've been pretty busy lately, and I bet you didn't finish all your homework last night, so you probably still have a lot to do
I just wish
OK now your online and I'm probably not going to talk to you
And you probably won't talk to me, because you're busy, and because I don't think I looked that happy to see you today, even though I really was
Can I convince Jeff that I don't need to think of all girls as possible sexual partners
That I actually just like being friends
I mean, yeah, I do really like you a lot, have for a long time
But
ugh
He walked southward
The wind blew against him
It was interesting to think that the wind was moving with everyone else who then occupied the path, and so it was more calm for them
The sea was now to his right, but it was to their left
Nobody minded the conflict of direction
It was as if the offender were not there
He could not have made a disturbance had he tried; it was as if he walked through them
The wind carried Alan Knudsen northward, following the ^Path between two disorders
The path itself was a sign of how far things had strayed from neat order and control
It wandered about, refusing to commit to a prescribed course
It resented the buildings that had shoved it so far against the sea, but could do nothing
It was forced to cling to the wall above the waters of its greatest enemy
The people could not see what it was that was so like them
They could only see what approached actually being them, and yet was so unkind to them
They could look in any direction and yet they looked inward on themselves, and never understood what they saw because they did not know through what they saw it
The body of Alan Knudsen continued northward
For a moment it seemed to meet a body that wasn't even there
There was an intuition, whose it was unclear, that this was Kmfe, given the brief glimpse of the real world from behind the bars of his fiction
The encounter ended without consequence of any form
It's that
you are insane, basically
I can no longer sympathize with or appreciate anything you do
I don't know why
Perhaps it's the inherent self-destructiveness you've shown me
I know plenty of other people with your same general ideas, but
much easier to get behind
Perhaps it's just that they can smile and hug me periodically
Live the life you want
I can't do anything about it
Just
PLEASE, make your own decisions
You are so much more at risk that you can really see
You are probably more at risk than I have been for a long time
At night it stays green along Broad Street
And there's a button to push when you want to cross
The instant you press the button, the light goes yellow, then quickly red
So if you wait around for a car, you can make it go red before they get there
Jo: Sounds mean
KMFE: Yes, it is mean
Or, what you can do is you push it when they get to the intersection, so it goes yellow, showing that you have the power, but you chose to spare them
Jo: Do you do any of these things
KMFE: No
I'm just giving you a survey of what's possible
Jo: I honestly don't think anyone would notice you
KMFE: I notice me
I wonder how soon after the light changing back to green you could repeat the process
You could really piss somebody off
Jo: They'd just go and maybe yell at you
Jo: Ask
KMFE: What's the word for someone whose role is to just facilitate the main character's rant
Jo: I don't know
KMFE: OK, cause whatever it's called you make a good one of those
Jo: Thank you
Was that your only question
KMFE: See what I mean
It must be because you don't exist
It makes it much easier
So no, that wasn't my only question
I was going to ask why everything :P writes makes my stomach hurt
But first another story, that happened long ago when I first asked that question
KMFE: Why does everything :P says make my stomach hurt
PL: Yes
I mean, I don't know
KMFE: All right, now let me explain why you saying "Yes
I mean, I don't know" does not seem particularly conducive to a nice discussion
See, you're probably right about you don't know
I don't think you do know
But that doesn't mean you have to say what is literally true
PL: I like saying what is literally true
KMFE: That very well may be
But, unfortunately, you do not get to write the rules of social engagement
Now you're free to make up your own rules if you like, but that does not change the reality you are living in
So I think it's kind of irrelevant whether you like saying what is literally true
All right back to my earlier point
So, if you offer a theory, probably not a correct theory since, as you said, you actually don't know, it provides an opportunity for me to say more, and it indicates to me what you understood
Saying "I don't know" doesn't tell me whether you even listened
In fact, who knows, maybe you didn't listen
I'm starting to suspect you at least didn't actually think about what I said
Now, even if you don't offer up a theory, you could say something along the lines of "could you elaborate
That gives me a clue that you will actually benefit from hearing more, and gives me an opportunity to continue the explanation
On the other hand, if you are honestly bored and apathetic to the discussion, you could either go somewhere else and stop talking to me, or say something like "sorry but I have nothing to add to that line of thought"
Something that doesn't leave me wasting my time talking about something about which you have no interest
Now this is particularly difficult talking online, because the conversation very quickly becomes one-sided
And that's just not worth it
It doesn't feel friendly either
It feels a little passive-aggressive, honestly
Especially since it becomes a battle to consume the other person's time without wasting any of your own
So I take it, then, that you don't actually want to discuss why everything :P writes makes my stomach hurt
PL: Well, I didn't have prior interest in the discussion, but if you want to talk about it that's fine
PL: I just might not have anything useful to say
KMFE: I'm inclined to say you still don't get it, but oh well
PL: yes
It is a somewhat pleasant change from the usual image of two muscley guys throwing a football from far opposite sides of the courtyard
Even the guy here is pretty small
They're sitting cross-legged and they throw the football about once every ten seconds
Neither of them looks especially excited
They stood up, and are now about 30 feet apart
Every time the girl catches the ball she turns it over a few times and looks at it
Suddenly the girl turns around and runs
The guy throws her a pass, but she's behind a tree so I don't know if she catches it
Eventually they go back to throwing it
It was a mistake
The drowning poem was the most unhappy thing she had ever written
It contained more emotion than she desired to show
It scared CK really bad
That's why she had shown it to so many people after that
She showed it to PPC so he would understand what CK had faced
It wasn't even to say anything about herself
She wanted PPC to understand what had happened to CK
But mostly she showed it to people so that CK wouldn't have been the only one to read it
She wanted to suck the emotion out of the poem so it wouldn't scare people and it wouldn't make her weak
That's why she showed it to KMFE
She didn't know or care what KMFE thought of her, and it was better to let him absorb the darker stories than for anyone else
She didn't know that KMFE cared so much for CK (despite having never met him)
She didn't know that CK reminded KMFE of himself, nor even fully guessed how much KMFE really knew about CK, or how much he'd been able to guess, or make up
So for KMFE seeing the drowning poem was enlightening exactly as Jo had intended for PPC
PPC, of course, had cared more about what the poem meant about Jo
But KMFE was not a passive reader
Having seen Jo's scariest idea, he gave her his
It was the freedom story
Jo: That's gross
KMFE: I would never actually do anything like it
Jo: It's a contradiction, too
I know you pity ll for how PL manipulated him
But that's because you think she had no right to decide for ll what mattered and what didn't
Killing ll would be just like that, only worse
KMFE: I really don't mean it to be a rational argument
I just want to express how much sadness I see in ll
Jo: Well, all the same I don't like it
And I think there's something more to it
The freedom story bothered Jo for several days
She let KMFE know this
Jo didn't expect that KMFE would be so happy about her discomfort
But KMFE had another story to explain that
The first story I showed to another person was The Cage
I was worried, really pretty nervous, that PL would get angry about the story
It's fairly critical of her and her friends, it says things in strange sarcastic ways
It's generally an unpleasant story
She told me she laughed through the whole thing
That's when I learned that my darkest and most unpleasant thoughts are elusive to other people
My writing doesn't make people upset
It makes them laugh
So I like it when I can scare people
You know I wrote the freedom story not much after the cage
And I showed that one to PL too
I don't think she gave it much thought
I am beginning to see the opposite problem
Basically, I can accomplish things
I draw an amazing drawing on AR's door
Several, actually
Two of them were stereograms
I don't lack accomplishment
But somehow that doesn't make AR like me
Which, in retrospect, seems obvious
Yet someone with the right personality doesn't need to do any of these things
I suppose my delusion has been a good motivator
It has driven me to do things I would not have done otherwise (or would I
Do I, in the end, care about AR, or is she just a thought to fill in the gaps
He had some sense he had done something mean to her more than a year ago
He got upset feeling guilty and pulled on his shirt so hard a button flew off, which he never found
He wore the shirt occasionally and didn't have an opportunity to explain the missing button
It's no wonder that some religions head to the river to wash away sins
Water has a way of forgiving
You can clean your memory with it
The robotics team was doing a car wash as a fundraiser
EKA decided whatever he had done to CR had been forgiven
He used to wonder if he cared about n because he felt guilty about CR
That probably wasn't true
But then it was a strange coincidence that the day CR forgave him was the day he forgot about n
Or did he
A few stories still had echoes of her
He made a clay jack o lantern
He painted the inside with red underglaze
This made him feel guilty, because red represents n
He went with his dad to take his dad's cat Rosy to the vet
He recognized the last name of the vet, and it stayed in his thoughts the whole evening
The colors blue and red are like the 2 and 3 ball in pool
It made EKA think of n
At a band practice, he spent most of the time thinking about what street he was on
But apart from those few stories, he had probably lost n
Once he had the book he tried not to waste time reading any of it, because he needed to sneak around DT again and out of the library
When he got outside there was a stream of people blocking his path
That's when DT walked out and saw KMFE with the book
KMFE could have just run away at this point except for the crowd of people in the way
He turned around to face DT, then yelled at DT to go away
That gave DT an excuse to detain KMFE and lecture him about showing respect for authority
So KMFE grabbed out his cell phone, called TDCP, and started reading the book into the phone for TDCP to copy down
DT grabbed KMFE's phone and turned it off
He took KMFE to an empty room, then took the book from KMFE
KMFE wouldn't know yet if he had gotten the important part over to TDCP
But DT looked nervous enough to suggest that maybe he had
DT: This is even more than showing respect for authority
What you're doing is dangerous
You should never have been allowed to have that book
You need to find TDCP and bring him here
KMFE: I just don't trust that
DT: There's no discussion here
You just do it
KMFE: You're
you're right that there's no discussion
That
I think is unavoidable
We disagree too much
Our worldview, our priorities are unrelated
But
there's no discussion, and I still won't go get TDCP
DT handed KMFE his phone
DT: Call TDCP now
Tell him to come here
Either you do it or I'll do it for you
KMFE: Do you
do you know Bartleby
By Melville
DT: That kind of attitude won't hurt anyone but yourself
KMFE: But you can't
you can't do anything about it
If I'm really stubborn, and I don't understand or agree with anything you say, you can't reach me
DT opened up KMFE's phone and scrolled through the contacts for TDCP's number
KMFE thought about screaming to get attention, but he didn't want other people in here
Or maybe that would be useful
Instead he started yelling out the parts of the book he could remember
DT started yelling at KMFE to shut up, drowning out KMFE
DT could yell much louder
TDCP answered the phone
At least there was no way TDCP could hear anything meaning now
DT tried to yell loudly into the phone but TDCP would never comprehend
A woman came out of the room next door to complain about the noise
DT apologized for KMFE's behavior
KMFE kept screaming
The woman folded her arms and waited patiently for the noise to stop
KMFE got tired of reciting the book and started preaching
He tried to argue, through screaming, that hiding information like that is evil
If he had had a medium more suited to nuance, he would have said that hiding information isn't necessarily evil in itself, but it's a good sign that something isn't right
A really good plan doesn't need to be kept secret because people will support it
DT took the position that nothing KMFE said bore any meaning, because KMFE was not handling it in a mature manner
This provoked KMFE into more preaching
He tried to say that sometimes you have to live with the kind of communication you know how to do
It's not always mature
It doesn't always make sense
But it can still be honest
And right now it didn't matter what the justification
It didn't matter how right or wrong KMFE might be
He was going to keep screaming and they couldn't stop him
Ultimately reality is king
KMFE: I'm thinking
EKA: Come up and watch the apocalypse with me
They walked up to the fourth floor lounge and sat looking out the window
Shoots of mist poured down from the sky onto the ground, knocking over whatever they fell on
KMFE didn't want to complain about the world ending
To obvious
He called AR to ask where she was
She didn't answer
Well
actually, a demon answered
They show up, towards the end of the world
I mean, at first you'd think that'd be obvious, but if you think about it, why would there be more demons at the end of the world than somewhere in the middle
Demon: Hey KMFE
KMFE: Hi
Demon: Look out the window
You can see me on the ground
I'm waiving to you
KMFE went to the movie and looked
He could see someone he thought he recognized from one of his ECE classes waving to him
Actually it was that annoying guy who talked the whole time in PEE and was at the table next to him in DLD
He was a little disappointed at that
This was a pretty
ordinary sort of demon
No ordinary's not the right word
It was really just that KMFE didn't like him
And you have to sort of like demons
Everyone loves to be evil, or see evil
Murderer's are classy
Bank robbers are sexy
Well, I mean, could you do the same to this
Could you get an element of class out of being an annoying person who talks in PEE
I mean it's the same idea, right
And
it's even better
Because he's alone
He's alone because unlike the wild west outlaw, he isn't flashy
People don't like him for how he annoys them
They have to like him for who he represents
And so it is only fitting that at the end of the world, when you call a friend and a demon answers, that you should look out the window and see him waving
No one is more qualified to fill that role
KMFE went downstairs (three flights -- took a while) and the demon wasn't there when he got to the bottom
Now's the time when he wished he had actually got to know this guy
Because now this guy is a REAL DEMON
And that's COOL
And KMFE had the chance, but he was
oblivious, and was just annoyed, and now he got an answer to his phone call but it was too late
Oh well, set down on the grass and watch the end of the world
It's pretty, actually
It's pretty because it's something else
The essence of beauty is something you can appreciate without taking part in
He went back inside and listened as a building just next door collapsed, taking with it a few dozen people
That was the end of their part in the story
Well I guess that's the end of the world for you
Alan Knudsen was the first to be inconvenienced by the absence of John Smith from work that morning
The first reason for this was that he had yet to discover the meaning behind "Possible important step, need discuss meeting" that had shown up in an email last night
The email was from '#3', which was most likely an alias of the missing person
The server dated it an hour before Alan had opened it, but the mysterious #3 had dated it December 1969, characteristic of the odd habits John Smith was beginning to develop
The second reason for the inconvenience was that  January's flight schedules were still in John Smith's possession
They had not yet been filed on the server and would need to be by the end of the October, which was two days away now
Alan Knudsen would not have been pleased had he known that John Smith had in fact forgotten to bring the flight schedules
The air on the second floor was always very still
Alan, still waiting for the imminent arrival walked to the bottom of the stairs where faults in the ventilation system created a constant flow of air through the hallway from the outside
This was strongest when the sun was warming the air and the building was still cold
Today was a very bright and sunny day
The air was beginning to dry with the season, but it still felt bland and unexciting
The second person to to notice John Smith's absence was 0235
There was nothing that she required of him
She was only intrigued to know what the next failing step of the ITA would be
0235 had realized that when she analyzed the ITA by its methods it led to a very different assessment than by analyzing its goals
An electric light was humming above here but that did not effect the conclusion
The ceiling above Alan seemed to curve slightly
Reluctantly conscious of it he looked up, seeing it at its normal flatness
Trying to reproduce the effect he looked forward again, but was too quickly distracted by the heavy stomp of a person reaching the end of the stairs
It was not easy to explain why this footstep seemed inappropriate to Alan
For a moment he had captured something floating on the wind and the footstep took a deliberate mind not to follow suit
The next thing that would have bothered him was the owner of the footstep, but he returned to consciousness before it would let itself
The rule is that the only method you are allowed to use is talking
You can't use physical force
The game ends when someone gives in
She won't do it
She had brought a ghost with her
It was in a jar, which she opened after walking in, to let it float around the room
That made KMFE nervous, since he had not had nice encounters with immaterial beings
He didn't want a repeat of his run-ins with angels
KMFE stood up and started apologizing to the ghost for his not welcoming her presence
Before he could get started the church collapsed
This was not, as KMFE first suspected, an attempt by GL to test the rules of the game as they applied to immaterial actors
GL did agree that even a ghost shouldn't be allowed to wreak physical havoc
But he didn't learn this from GL, he learned it from :P, because she had made the building collapse
How so
It doesn't even matter what the rules are
Jeff's story should have told you that much
Everyone worships the wrong gods
You know they must be wrong because it keeps changing
Religion overtakes religion again and again
Or as Dawkins said, everyone's an atheist, with respect to some god
Surely you wouldn't think I'm really an angel
Jo, TDCP and GL (with her ghost) had left about ten minutes ago
KMFE knew that soon :P would disappear back into her world, but right now he could pretend to understand who she was
Jo had taken the radio with her, which was the one thing KMFE wanted to show :P, but he suspected that somehow she already knew about it
They walked to the train station and :P left on the first train
KMFE stood around for a little while because he had absolutely nothing to do
He wished just once :P would let him in on what all the mystery was
I got off the A at Hill Center and walked back across Busch to my dorm
In the campus center there was a Horse Show
Around the campus center were a lot of lost people looking for the horse show
And they were pretty bad at following directions, too
I told that guy to go to the parking lot and turn left, but he went straight
Then I pointed at him where to go and he ignored me
Back at the dorm I lay in Prapti's bed reading while Samiha talked with her boyfriend from Bangladesh on the phone
I had to be extra quiet because she was trying to convince him that she was in Connecticut
There was a story behind that, but I forget it
Samiha's pretty good at getting caught up in a difficult sequence of lies
Like the time she avoided dinner with Grace by saying she didn't eat dinner
Then had to hide during dinner for awhile
Liz walked in and I asked her how the horse food tasted (Samiha told me that story)
Liz said accusingly at Samiha Liz: I told you not to tell anyone
Me: No I'm really curious, how did it taste
She paused awkwardly
Liz: Don't
eat it
It's not meant for people
There were some huge dogs there that day
We saw Grace talking to some
Huge white furry dogs
They were related somehow to the Horse Show
He walked with his try towards the tables and tried to look straight ahead
There's probably a lot of people he sort of knows here, and he doesn't like making the decision of whether he knows a person well enough to go over and say hi, ask to sit with them, etc
It's such a tricky continuum
He did see Andrew, though, at a table right in front of him, and he knew for sure that he could sit with Andrew, so that was a quick way to get out of the awkward table-finding process and into actually sitting and eating
Andrew looked happy to see him, was doing the Targum crossword, and probably didn't have anywhere to go in a hurry
They cooperated on the crossword for awhile before Andrew moved into real conversation
There was a constricting familiarity about the ^Hub
You had, of course, seen it many times before
Today, as each of those times, you ascended the long, low steps to the first level
Huge pillars towered above you
Had you looked up, you would have seen the vast buildings that rose about you
You would have seen yourself so small in comparison
But you never looked up
You had seen it so many times before and lost interest in the sight
The weather, you thought, was rather nice
Its gloomy mood was a nice distraction from the monotony of life
Walking deeper into the depths of the ^Hub, the weather disappeared entirely
Noise surrounded you
People you had not noticed so much on the ^Path became a cloud in front of you now
You pushed slowly forward against the sudden intrusion into your thoughts of sound and touch
The walls were pale yellow, and it had amused you once to think that the color had been selected as the ugliest possible
Experience had worn away any attention you once paid to the walls
The ceiling was high, about ten feet, but felt low
Dim lights were set into it at even intervals
The hallway opened to the left, and you took it, heading through the maze-like building to the stairs
Halfway down the next hall, the colors changed abruptly, where the newer segment of the building began
Here had been selected a muddy purple scheme
The uneven floor was hard, and would have felt cold had you ever felt it
The stairs tried to imitate a happier feeling but failed, a failure which turned to something almost gloomy with the echoes that fell down from the level above
The second level was better lit
The colors changed again, this time to different shades of gray
The room was divided into four quadrants by thin partitions
Scattered throughout were tables, randomly placed papers, several filing cabinets, computers, and people
In the far quadrant, which you did not see yet, but knew was there, was the central server for the communications network in the ^Hub
The server was generally accepted as the most important thing in the whole building
You saw the people who everyday occupied the second floor
One was busily sorting and filing something, trying hard not to look bored
Another pushed a cart with some very insignificant looking boxes across to the door opposite you
Papers, folders, floppy disks, bags, boxes and people were moving in random patterns all over the room
As you started to move into the room towards the first quadrant, you felt a strong pain in your chest
Breath seemed cut off
You felt very sick, and it worsened
You were unconscious two minutes later
Running on the sidewalk
See bus stop ahead
People standing around, are going to block your path
Before you get there the bus shows up
People form a line as the bus doors open
You run right by them without looking up
Bus driver looks up, wonders if you're running for the bus, but you just keep on running
People there aren't happy with what they're doing
They want to move from waiting for the bus to sitting on the bus
You're content with what you're doing
You don't even look up
That's a nice moment
A sad moment
Lab today
Three hours
Went through lunch
AR not at the dining hall by the time you get there
Don't talk to her all day
After you get back from running, get on Facebook and see her day was stressful and unpleasant
Yours was, well, you didn't see her
That makes you not want to go to bed until maybe you can talk to her
But you can't
A funny moment
Jeff calls
Want to have dinner
Well, you're going swing dancing at 8:30
Get off the phone
Weird stares from your suitemates
OK, you're going to have to explain that
Watch old funny video on Youtube and adopt the phrase "those cats are solid"
Go to swing dancing, it's really fun, get back, and everyone's impressed you had the courage to go
Dance with Jeff
Endure jokes
Fade back into the life of the engineering suite
When you think about AR you realize what doesn't seem right
The past
Dwell on it
Think about it
Reenact it
Figure out the parts you missed when they were happening
You understand it better now
The only thing you lost is the emotions
Is AR part of the past
Well, of course, everyone is
How do you stop her from fading into the past you can control
If you can control your image of her, she's not real anymore
She must defy your understanding in order to exist
Confession
Admitting that you don't show your honest thoughts to most people
Admitting that you'd like to
Admitting to AR for the first time how you thought of her last year
Thinking that you can't take things back
Information matters
You can't unsay things
If you had the chance, would you unsay that
Never
Never in a million years
Feeling awkward the next day
Wondering if AR will notice your silence
Thinking she's busy, and better off not talking to you
But her day was not nice anyway
And you miss her
Remembering how you once asked why the truth always ruins things
Deciding that you would not trade this truth for any lie
Silence
AR responds with silence
It's not til later that you form a mental image of her sitting there blushing, fingers above the keys not yet daring to type
Wishing the image to be true, and refusing to glance at the picture of her dragging a laundry basket back to the room, closing the door, bending over the screen and giggling
AR's not much of a giggler anyway
Read the time stamps
She only paused for 5 minutes
Her first words were "haha"
If that were you, it could be awkwardness
Grep and find it only once
Awkwardness has meaning
Closing
Turn around and ask roommate How do you make grep color by default
Add an alias
Back to reality
Go to bed
Alex: You should tell Erin
She'd like that
Chris: Well it wasn't really a castle
It was a big building
But you can only see it when the sun is behind us
Then it reflects off the top
At sunset Chris found Erin and brought her to the window
It was a clear day, and the flatness of the desert made it feel like you could see forever
When the sun had almost gone below the horizon the building appeared as a shiny specter
Only the top was lit, which made it appear to float in the air
Erin: Wow
that is pretty
Chris: I'm surprised it's there at all
And that we haven't seen it before
Maybe you can only see it on a totally clear day
Erin: That must be illegal, how few lights they're using
It doesn't look illuminated at all
Except for the sun
Chris: How long does an alien occupation usually last
Erin: Haha, there isn't any usual outside of science fiction
Why are you thinking about it
Chris: I just want to be able to talk to people without it having to go through an automatic translator
Erin: You wouldn't be able to talk to me without it
It was true; Erin wasn't from Earth
Chris took his frustration out on the translation algorithm by calling Erin a made-up word
She must have heard something else because she answered "I can't"
Next day Chris had disappeared
Erin waited for sunset to watch the castle and imagine Chris had gone there
Alex found her standing by the window
Alex: Wow, there really is a castle
Erin: That can't be legal, can it
Using no lights like that
Alex: I have trouble believing it's even real
Erin: Let's measure it, though
They got a spectrometer and found that the total power emitted was many times below the legal minimum
Alex: Unless there's something way down in radio waves, or way up in gamma rays
Erin: That would be scary
Alex: It would be fitting
PL: Try playing a different suite
KMFE waved his hand in the air over the cards
KMFE: Look, just
don't
He said it in a kind of angry way, or at least
not friendly
It was direct
PL was quieter
PL: OK
KMFE was uncomfortably aware of n sitting behind him watching the whole scene
n could look very impressive just by observing
Earlier
Today was a good day
In some ways
KMFE and PL weren't fighting today
They seemed to stop hating each other at ll's house, and now things were mostly peaceful
Still, earlier
n had tried to stop KMFE and PL from holding hands
But
what
had happened
The card game ended and KMFE and PL were just sitting together
n kicked a plastic chair towards them
n: This chair is your chaperon
PL: Chair chaperon
KMFE knocked the chair over swiftly with his arm
Later he would realize he did it for n
Because he thought she could respect violence more than affection
That's not what it seemed like next time he talked to PL
He told her how he and n are the same person, but chose quite different lives
And he wanted to show n that his choice wasn't as awful as she made it out to be
That love isn't all bad
That's what he told PL then
Later he realized n was probably right
And he wished he'd seen it sooner
Now here's the puzzling bit
n seemed to hold her view that "love sucks" despite never (KMFE was pretty sure about this) having a boyfriend
KMFE came to this conclusion through experience
Jeff thinks that just because you come to something later doesn't make it more right -- it's just different
But it still felt to KMFE that he should know this better than n
So the conclusion of that seems to be "n was right, KMFE should have listened to her all along
And Char was right
Anyone who told PL she was going to cause trouble was right
Anyone (like ll) who warned KMFE he was walking into trouble was right
But (with the exception of ll), none of them really knew
KMFE knew
In had not been mowed in a long time, and the grass was more than waist deep in places
She stopped in the middle near a tulip tree
So he'd seen it very briefly a few times so long ago he barely remembered
Once a few years from the present he had walked here late at night to look at it, but a police officer had shown a flashlight on him the whole time and made him feel uncomfortable
Now KMFE thought she could mean the field, but probably something trickier and subtler than that
Because if it were just the field then he might be able to understand, and :P wasn't going to let that
Though she might have, a long time ago
If only he could remember better who she used to be, he'd have some chance of fighting back when she played these weird games with his mind
He didn't remember her then like he didn't remember dreams
He should have all the advantages here
This was familiar territory to him, if somewhat forgotten
And it was night, which is when he always went outside, not liking to meet people, so he was used to navigating the area by dark
And he could think of weird philosophical games as well as she could
But :P had an eternal advantage over him
Years ago she refused to fight him on his territory
Now that didn't seem to matter
It's a set-up
The radio they told you could listen on the galaxy was a recording
The organization was a front
None of the people are who they say they are
He considered accusing her of keeping this a secret
Or saying that whatever organization it was had caused real havoc that affected the lives of pretty much everyone on earth, so it couldn't all be fake
Or that it was still going on, and back at home he still had the uniform
So he said “I think you should elaborate
The mock paradise detaches you from reality
It's more pervasive than you think
Do I look real
Don't ask a question, because then all they have to do is answer it
Stop saying that
You made up every detail about her
It's only one small step to realize you made up her very existence
I'm reminded of Dawkins again
Maybe he should argue about what existence is
At the very least, n exists for him
Maybe he shouldn't
But n must exist even more for :P
So he told :P that there are many ways for a person to exist
That didn't mean what he wanted it to mean and he knew it
It was time to stop arguing
He told :P that n did exist and he was going to find her
He was going to walk there, now
And he'd need to wear the uniform
Because one thing you need when you go to find a person detached from reality is a sign that you are no less detached than they are
He ran out of the upper field and into the park
He ran to the bridge that he had named after n, in his mind
He stood for a few minutes looking into the water
It made him feel nervous that :P might follow him here even though she wouldn't really do him any harm
Last time he stood here he had wanted to jump into the water, just for the heck of it, but then didn't
So to get a good start for his existential adventure he jumped in now
Then :P showed up, running lightly down the gravel hardly touching the ground
She saw him and burst out laughing
You're pathetic
But you're hilarious
Though of course in a delicate balance of laughing with and laughing at
The bottom of the river was very silty and now he was very muddy
See you're boring me already
He'd do anything if he thought it would make her laugh
He didn't jump in again, though
He asked if she wanted to go search out the stuff being left for bulk pick-up day, but she said no she was going home now, it was late and she wanted to sleep
So she would see him later
Then she left and KMFE walked back home soaking wet and muddy
And so would have ended his battle with :P in the manner it always did, with him confused and :P entertained
But she'd questioned reality
He couldn't just let that go
So he called n
Erin wasn't really worried, because she assumed he'd never come back, but she kept imagining he was in the sunset building
It had been too cloudy recently to see it
Alex was worried, because he wasn't used to people disappearing
He didn't usually talk about things that were bothering him
But Erin was the best person to ask
This night was clearer, and the building was faintly visible, still with no light of its own
It's a wonder something hadn't hit it yet
Alex: So, um
Chris
Erin: Alex, he hasn't been around for weeks
Alex: Well, I mean, that's kind of exactly it
Erin: Is that strange to you, I mean you being from Earth, that he isn't around
Alex: Well, I mean, no, not exactly
It's not like people never disappear on Earth
Erin: Is it because it's Chris
Alex: Like, it's not like it's strange that he's gone, it just
bothers me
Because, well, what, I mean, what's happening to him
I mean like is he OK
He didn't say he was leaving
Erin: I doubt he's coming back
He's probably dead
Alex: Like seriously
Like just dead
Erin: I like to imagine he's in the castle
Alex: But I mean for real, he's dead
Erin: I don't know, so I can just say he's in the castle
The translation algorithm stripped out all of Alex's filler words, but Erin could still tell he was a little uncomfortable
But she didn't let it bother her
She looked back out the window towards the East
But the building was fading now

ignap cbincod  Hey guys you know you can convert Open Office documents to LaTeX Oh god I don't wanna see that output
Alex: I don't understand, what would make him just disappear
Erin: Hmm
do I have to talk about it
It makes it hard to pretend
Alex: Erin, I thought you cared about Chris
Erin: I do care about him
I always will
Alex: So, why doesn't it bother you that he's gone
Erin: I think
I think you're looking at it wrong
I care about Chris so I want him to be in the castle
Alex: But
he's NOT
So what good is pretending
Erin: What good is fretting about it
I can't be that cruel
He slouched in his chair and stared at the desk
Saturn walked in looking distracted
God didn't look up
Saturn found the book he was looking for, then noticed God
Saturn: Something wrong, God
God: I'm not creating life, Saturn
I can't put them through that
Saturn: Well, it's your decision
But it's the only way you're gonna survive
God: I know, Saturn
Just let me mope on this for awhile
Saturn stood silently for five minutes, then spoke again
Saturn: If you don't create life, no one will remember you
You'll disappear into an eternity of nothingness
You won't feel the passage of time
You won't exist
God shuddered
He wished Saturn would let him stop thinking about it
Saturn: You know all along you would come to this point
We knew it too, before you were born
God: I know, Saturn
Please go away
Saturn quietly left the room
Half an hour later God got up from his desk and went to find Saturn
God: It just seems so cruel, Saturn
To put people through life, suffering from birth to death
Confused, unsure why they exist, dreading the future
And so many of them, created in the world only to be imprisoned forever in immaterial nothingness
All just to preserve some old deity
Saturn: It's cruel God, I know
God: I thought you might try to tell me about happiness in life
Saturn closed his book and set it on the table
Then he straightened up and faced God
Saturn: I wouldn't try to tell you that, God
Happiness just leaves a person something to be bitter about
The universe was made to be cruel and it will be so until the end
God stood there biting his fingernails
God: It's really very simple, isn't it
Saturn: It is
But it's your decision
God walked back into his room
A few minutes later he came out again
God: I won't do it, Saturn
Saturn: Suit yourself
He didn't look up from his book
God waited a few seconds and then left to go to bed
Saturn couldn't be so cruel, either
He had know God since God was born, and hated to see his friend vanish
Saturn put his book down, walked into God's work room, and created life for him
That probably wasn't the right song
AR's status was "I've got a feeling"
And it was a song
And it was for someone
So KMFE had to decide that once again he was setting himself up for being jealous and he probably ought to just stop thinking about AR and move on with his life
Anyway today was going to be a busy day
Right now he was just leaving for robotics club
Good place for the spirit of moving on with your life
Worked well a long time ago
The most intense time
The most alive
Really he just felt cold
He walked to the EE building with Michael and really thought about AR the whole time
Then the meeting got underway and he got distracted, even if he still felt a little cold
But today was even busier than that
Half an hour into the meeting he left to get on an H bus
Lilly had suggested he go to RSU
He had no clue what was going to happen, but it turned out to be about the ward campaign
Actually, it was the ward campaign
And
somehow he wound up promising to help
Not that he really had a clue what kind of government was right for New Brunswick
There were two people there he hadn't seen in a long time
From RUMUN
This was a strange world
KMFE left once things seemed to have ended
Lilly told him he ought to go to some thing called Stone Soup on Monday
KMFE started imagining a conversation with Jeff at this point
Then he left
Now it was kind of late, like 10:30, and probably not the time you'd want to be calling someone, but
well, here he was on College Ave, a few minutes walk from Stonier, so he called AR
Even though he was sure he shouldn't
She answered and said she wasn't at her dorm
And it sounded really, really awkward
It was another time for imagining
This time that she was lying in bed with Sean or whoever and had neglected to turn off her phone
And of all the people who could call, KMFE proudly considered himself the most awkward
He knew that it was cruel to take pleasure in an awkward moment for AR
But it just seemed fitting
He could imagine all sorts of things from there
Why hadn't he seen AR online in so long
Well, maybe Sean got suspicious
Things could get interesting
Of course, in reality, probably nothing interesting happened
But well, that doesn't stop anyone from imagining
But I tell you how I would have done it
KMFE: Will and Lyra would not have to separate
They'd stay together in Lyra's world
But things will go bad for a number of reasons
KMFE: First, they're way too young
They're going to screw this up simply because they don't know how to get along with someone so good
It takes practice being around someone for a long time and not pissing them off
KMFE: Also, Will always used to be a solitary person
He's going to have a really hard time at it
And he's not going to have many friends besides Lyra so she'll have a hard time getting away from him
He's going to get on her nerves pretty fast
KMFE: Especially since the adventure's over
They're going to be bored, and they'll take it out on each other
KMFE: So if I were writing the ending, they'd stay together, and grow to hate each other
And they'd still remember happily the whole adventure story, because it was exciting and meaningful, but it would be tainted by the knowledge of what they have become since then
KMFE: And that ending would suck
But I feel it is right
Jo: It would seem to me that you have become obsessed with failed relationships
Perhaps if you had a happier relationship you would take on a new perspective
KMFE: But that's not possible
It has to end eventually
If I keep trying for a happy relationship more depressing ones will just pile up
Jo: They don't have to be depressing
Something can end without failing
KMFE: It puzzles me that you are being the optimistic one, despite that you have had two miserable relationships to my one
And, I gather, far more miserable ones at that
Jo: No, but don't you see, that's exactly it
I'm the optimistic one because I endured something even worse and didn't give up
KMFE: I guess what we have here is correlation does not imply causation
Jo: We do indeed
In the fifteen minutes I had been sitting there it had already gotten dark
We didn't canvass for very long, but it was fun
The scary thing is, though, that aside from Michelle I was the only person there
I suppose not suprising on the Friday night before Homecoming
With a campaign run primarily by students
Michelle said we'd do the frist few streets together and then split up
But I bet it would not be so great canvassing alone at night in new Brunswick, and we didn't split up
Then the fireworks started, and that pretty clearly put an end to things -- you couldn't be heard above the explosions
One door we knocked on there was a party going on
They invited Michelle to join them
She told me she might after we finished
Almost every door we knocked on was students
We were in what was known as a "student ghetto"
Michelle said that landlords around here don't live up to their legal obligations -- that's one reason students want a representative on the city council
I still kind of felt guilty for being there, since Michelle kept calling or receiving calls about her sister's fight
I felt like I was dragging her away from a situation she wanted to be dealing with
But she never complained
But overall the experience made me feel more positive about the ward campaign
She showed him a page
GL: See this part's by Gerald Sussman
TDCP: What book is that
He went to look closer but she pulled the book away
GL: No, you can't see
TDCP: Come on, what is it
GL set the book on the table then wrestled TDCP to the floor
GL: You're not putting up much of a fight
TDCP: Well, come on
I'm being pinned by a pretty, smart, funny girl
How hard do you expect me to struggle
GL had trouble responding to this statement
She knew she was being flattered, which was nice even if it wasn't completely sincere
But it was hard to keep herself in a combative mindset while her victim was complimenting her
She decided that praise was just another weapon and she'd treat it as such
TDCP lay motionless for about twenty more seconds then tried to get up
GL quickly stopped him
He could see how awkward this was for her, but she wasn't the one being pinned
TDCP: Look, just tell me the title so I can check it out of the library
He made another effort to struggle but he really was trapped, unless maybe if he fought harder than he wanted to
GL didn't look very strong, but that might be misleading
Finally she couldn't take the awkwardness any longer, so she jumped up, quickly grabbed the book and put it in her backpack
TDCP slowly got up and sat down again in a chair
He thought of apologizing but figured that would probably make things worse
He really ought to leave, but in a manner that made it clear he held nothing against her
In fact, he had no legit excuse to leave right now
He had nowhere to be for the rest of the day, no classes tomorrow, and not much homework this weekend
He could say he was tired, but that was the oldest excuse out there
Maybe if he smiled enough, and then went to check the bus schedule online
He'd either have to borrow GL's computer or go to the library, and if he were leaving for real he would just go to the bus stop and wait at most half an hour
TDCP thought through these things for ten minutes, just sitting in the chair looking at his knuckles while GL smiled awkwardly at him
Now desperate for a way out, TDCP broke the silence with a question
TDCP: So, do you know much about Chávez
GL: I do know a little bit
TDCP: I've always wondered: is he legit
I mean he calls himself a socialist, but I always have trouble buying it
GL went into a sort of rambling explanation of Bolivarism, and TDCP tried to follow it as best he could because he really was puzzled by Chávez
This topic was emotionally important to GL, who had an intuitive connection with politics that was quite beyond TDCP's comprehension
As an engineering student, he liked to think that all the world's problems could be addressed -- perhaps not solved but at least productively addressed -- through a scientific approach
But no amount of data (at least in his limited experience) would compete with GL's intuition
He was forced to admit the explanation that the brain itself was a scientific tool, and a good one that had been tweaked and improved a few billion years using a planet's worth of computing resources
Maybe he should give up engineering and switch to political science; after all the polisci faculty here did seem pretty l33t
But then he'd be daily frustrated by the -- perhaps imagined -- lack of scientific rigor
Hampering all these thoughts was the question of what to make of his social interaction with GL right now
He had no more intuition for social situations than for politics
He figured that by calling her a "pretty, smart, funny girl" he had begun the process of flirting with her and should continue thus
Well, he wasn't sure in what category GL would place talking about Latin American socialists
At any rate she seemed even more socially awkward than he was, and was probably happier to talk about Chávez
TDCP thought that while the upside of GL's social awkwardness was that if he made a serious blunder she might not notice, there were some serious downsides
First, it made it harder to reach implicit agreement on what exactly counted as flirting
Then he wasn't sure if GL knew a tactful way to tell him that she had a boyfriend, if that were indeed the case (TDCP had no idea)
And it might mean (and this looked increasingly likely) that he'd overanalyzed the whole thing and this really was nothing more than a friendly conversation about Andean politics
In fact, his whole internal episode of fretting might be a spontaneous combustion, unprovoked by GL and not relevant to anything in the real world
Apparently at random (did this discussion have an end
So that was that
TDCP went to the bus stop and waited twenty minutes for a bus
It felt like ages
He wanted to put the awkwardness behind him by getting off of this campus
He tried to read (Das Kapital) to take his mind off it, but the convoluted prose of Marx is hard to follow with inadequate attention
He read the same page three times before the bus showed up
Now usually when deer are just standing there by the path and you run by them they run away
Even though they really could easily kick your ass if they wanted to, they think you're a predator and they take off
These ones just stood there
So KMFE ran back a few paces and stopped to look at them
They still didn't move
He put his hands on his hips in a disapproving manner, glaring at them
Why don't you run away like you're supposed to
One deer walked up towards him, and he was a little nervous because it looks like a strong animal, but he knew he had the advantage of being the predator
The deer jumped up and kicked him over with its front feet
KMFE fell down hard onto the grass
The deer ran away
The impact to KMFE's chest was impressive
He figured some ribs must be broken
He walked back to the campus health center (not far away, luckily), and somebody there told him that his ribs weren't broken
They thought he was in a fight, and that made them nervous
KMFE: I was attacked by a deer
Person: You know deer don't just run up to people and attack them
KMFE: That's what happened
Person: Were you in a fight
KMFE didn't answer because he didn't like it when people didn't believe him
Person: If you were in a fight, we need to know, because other people might be hurt too
KMFE: I wasn't in a fight
Person: You were attacked by a deer
KMFE: Yes
Person: That sounds very strange
KMFE didn't say anything
Person: Were you bothering the deer
KMFE: Look, I don't care whether you believe me or not
I just told you what happened and you can take it how you like
Person: OK OK, I'm just concerned because you got hurt
And I want to know if other people might be hurt too
Were there other people around
KMFE: No
Person: It was just you and the deer
KMFE: There were other deer around
Person: Did they all attack you
KMFE: No, just one
Person: And it just ran up to you and attacked you, you say
Did it kick you
KMFE: Yes
Person: Like jumped up and kicked you in the chest
KMFE: Yes
Person: Had you been drinking
KMFE: No
Person: All right, well, that's one of the strangest stories I've ever heard
KMFE: Wow, you've had a boring life
Person: What, you don't think that's kind of interesting, that a deer just came up and attacked you
KMFE: But the strangest story you've ever heard
Person: Well, no, I mean it's a figure of speech
KMFE: That's fortunate
Person: Look, I'm not asking you to like me, I just want to know what happened
KMFE: I told you what happened
Person: Well yeah, and I think it was pretty strange
They reached a ladder in the corner and climbed up to a roof
1,4,5,9,3 A Fibonacci sequence and an exponential sequence modulo 11, since (1, 4) is an eigenvector of [ [0 1] [1 1] ]
The period, 5, must divide phi(11) which is 10
KMFE wrote this sequence several times on the wall
He had a long time to sit here and not much else to do
You could see several blocks from this roof
It was around 11:30 PM and a little cold
He could see two people standing on the other side of the street not moving
Holding his head so that a tree branch lined up with a street light two blocks away, car headlights moved from his left eye to his right
It was funny
One time the Eagle really lost it and started throwing things wildly
Rob took offense and smugly said he was leaving
EKA rolled his eyes
Rob was one of those people you just can't deal with
That you can't trust (RSLL is like that too)
Rob likes the Eagle his skills, but has no respect for him
KMFE hoped that Rob wouldn't be a plague
So how can you get out of this
How can you escape a person who insists on influencing your life
Who you can't get to go away because of how they might react
So far KMFE had just endured
But why did everyone else not see the problem
Particularly PL
She saw people how she wanted to see them
Maybe she had a secret crush on Rob
Like how she got all mock-surprised and happy in that sickening way when Rob told her that she was his friend
How she told KMFE so many times in that sweet surprised voice with the explanation that it was unexpected
And it made KMFE feel sick
Or when she bragged too much that she was ABNE's biggest fan because Rob had told her so, and was much put off by being told that they were, really, their own biggest fan
Because of this vision, she refused to see the plague that Rob could cause
But why won't you
Can't you just do it
This is my life we're talking about
It's easy for you to make up your little fantasy when you're safely miles away but THIS IS MY LIFE
She'd say the same thing about me
About n
I did make up my story
It probably had nothing to do with reality
It was probably torture for you to think about
But you stole it from me so mercilessly
I don't think you were trying to hurt me, but you had no idea what mattered and it was arrogant of you to decide any issue in my life
That I do not forgive
I was going to the campus center to get quarters from the vending machine
Outside it was damp, misty, cold, a little windy
You could see the glow of streetlights against water droplets
I was humming
It's too bad sheebeg sheemore has no lyrics
Perhaps they could start, Tonight it rains
The streetlights shine on glowing water in the air  At the campus center bus stop a rowdy mob of drunk people tried to get on the bus, as they were blocked by a mob of drunk people getting off the bus
The vending machine was sold out
Back at the suites the courtyard was pretty empty
A lot of people went home for the weekend
There's just a few guys smoking at a table
Looking at each other and talking
And in the far corner, where it's dark, a girl smoking alone
You have to feel a little sympathy for the smokers when you see them outside alone in the cold
If there wasn't smoke in the air providing a protective barrier, I would go talk to them
Lonely people are
are they interesting
Do I ever talk to lonely people, or do they seem interesting because they are hard to reach
I can't imagine why she thought that, since what she was reading was some rather strange and vague philosophical stuff, bearing no relation to my life, my memories, or my experience
And it's completely wrong
Because that would imply that I am trying to get rid of those ideas, free them from my mind, by putting them in words
That is not why I put things in words
I write to preserve ideas
Because if they stay in my mind then I will forget them, and they will disappear forever
Imagine that, a memory, a thought, an experience, disappearing forever
I don't like that
So I write things down
But there's so much I have not written
So much has already been lost
And I will never be able to write everything
And even when I can capture the facts of the situation, the feeling is often lost
So the description will always be incomplete
And the writing is a little painful
Things become more real when I write them, not less
If I wanted to get rid of a thought that had been bothering me, the worst way to do it would be to write it down
I write things down that I want to keep with me forever
Jeff understands this
He doesn't like the idea of things disappearing, either
But most people seem ok with that
Most people are ok with forgetting
RE is ok with forgetting
And few people write stories
Sometimes fact doesn't quite cut it – the only way to communicate my thoughts is in fiction
So what's the difference
Why does this matter to some people but not others
Jeff said I did a bad thing by deleting my conversations with PL (I agree)
And then he said “especially someone who refers to it as external memory”
So I wondered, does Jeff see us as an elite bunch of people, those who can see things as external memory
He said no
I wonder if that's true
Then there's the analogy of the fence
I wonder if writing more will keep me on the negative side, or if it will push me onto the positive side
I was impressed that xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx had written a coherent story entirely through Twitter over the course of 7 months
I don't generally think of people named xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx as having that kind of attention span
I was actually even impressed by the content of the story
But what really piqued my interest were the things the story didn't say, the gaps in between the tweets
So I'll spare you the juicy details (you can go read them for yourself if you want
This is the internet, after all) and say that it was a fairly straightforward first-encounter-to-culminating-sex-scene romance between a man and a mermaid
The man's boat had been smashed apart on the rocks near the Orkney Islands and left him stranded
As he's sitting on the rock at sunrise, head in his hands going over his miseries and wondering what can he possibly do next, he hears the mermaid, who happens to be sitting on the same rock behind him, playing a harp
The next tweet is what caught my eye and got me to actually keep reading
It read simply "she was playing good day sunshine"
Then the story moves on, no further comment
That's a Beatles song
It's not some eerie mermaid tune
But if you think about it, if mermaids actually exist, and if they can have harps and play music, it's not any harder to believe that they can play Beatles songs
So I was impressed that xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx trusted her audience to realize and accept this fact with no further explanation
This story was meant as a mutual exercise between author and reader
The story allots 23 tweets to describing the man
xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx tells us every detail of the man's physical characteristics
And he is beautiful
The mermaid gets only one tweet: "she was blond"
Since this is fiction, the man could have had this romantic story with any woman on earth
xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx chose to involve a mermaid, a creature known for its beauty, and then make no use of it
From this I can only conclude that xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx saw herself as the mermaid, but why that would be so, and even then why she would give herself no defining traits beyond hair color, is still to me a mystery
The next couple of months aren't as good
So far xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx had given the narrative a sort of melancholy bite that made it sound like she was two weeks away from suicide
The enigmatic "she was blond" preceded a two week pause during which xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx apparently cheered up quite a bit, and it just wasn't the same
It didn't get good again until the scene with the kiss
The kiss itself warrants no more words than "he kissed her", but it's a really big deal for the mermaid
The man sees she's so pleased and surprised that he asks her if she's ever kissed before
She decides it must be "some silly ritual from New Jersey" (which is where the man is from)
She's quite hurt, because she thought it was something new and special the man had made up, and it's just part of some game they play back home
The rest of the story isn't interesting until the end
Specifically, how abruptly it ends, just at the close of the first and only sex scene
The man's still stuck there on the rock
He has no food or fresh water, no phone, no clothes at this point, no transportation
xxnucl34rk1tt3nxx has been with this man in fiction for 7 months now, and she leaves him there
Leaves him either to die there, as things are set to happen, or be rescued in a plot the reader must dream up
Rereading the story before I wrote these comments I noticed that the sex scene itself is a bit rushed, like she's trying to get it over with real fast
I suspect the motivation to ditch the fictional man existed long before the story actually ended
But then in Twitter everything seems a bit rushed, and I might be imagining it
KMFE: Hi is this a good time to talk because I have a point of inquiry with a lengthy preface
DP: Uh yeah, I was just watching TV but it's not like something I can't miss
KMFE: All right, so I was wondering if I could recruit you for a sort of secret-agent mission
DP: Are you spying on Russia
KMFE: This is a personal issue between me and Jeff
DP: You want me to spy on Jeff
I don't know, KMFE
KMFE: No
All right, listen, this will require some explanation
Jeff and I are involved in a sort of game, you might say
It's, um, complicated
DP: Who's winning
KMFE: Jeff, definitely, at this point
So, it's a bit of a spy game, if you will
I have strong reason to believe that Jeff has recruited AR to help him
He has presumably revealed key details of the plan to her
I have three goals
First, learn about the plan
Then, disrupt the plan
Lastly, get back at Jeff, ideally by having the plan backfire on him
So I was wondering if you could talk to AR and find out details relevant to these goals
DP: So what be like "Hey AR what secret plans have you and Jeff been planning
KMFE: Um, no, of course not
Because it is extremely important that AR not know that you have communicated with me about this
Otherwise I'd talk to her myself
If AR finds out you talked to me, Jeff will find out, and it'll give the whole game away
So I was wondering if you could maybe casually ask AR what her plans are for the rest of summer, etc, without ever indicating that you know something's up, and letting her be the one to bring up Jeff's or my name
Also, I have reason to believe that AR is away or busy for a week and can't assist Jeff until that's over
So you might ask her what her plans are when she gets back
That also means you have some time
DP: Well, I don't know, KMFE, this sounds like it's gonna be hard to get the information without giving it away
How careful to I have to be about not mentioning your name
KMFE: I think, for now, it's better to not get the information than to give away that I asked
If you can't get anything, talk to me and we'll see
The essay showed how you could get complicated, chaotic patterns from just "+" and "for (;;)", as it were
But the question that KMFE wanted to answer is, just how much do you have to trim off before you can't get any interesting result
How much less powerful does math have to be before it is stubbornly boring
Set theory looks extremely simple but from it you can derive the natural numbers, the real numbers, etc
But look at the axioms closely and you see that they are all simple but one: the axiom of subsets, which is more or less:  "Given any sentence P(X) with a free variable X, and a set A, there exists a subset B of A where x is in B if and only if P(x) is true
It's no surprise, then, with that kind of flexibility, that amazing things can be done with set theory
What if we trimmed it down a bit
D smiled "oh
Poor AE's mood changes so quickly
He smiled and she always smiled back whether or not it was appropriate
KMFE tried to jump over the fence and knocked it down
He started trying to put it back up but it wouldn't fit together right
D walked out
KMFE realized KK hadn't been pointing at the elf-face but at the drawing behind it, a room with tables
no I don't think so
I thought she said she did
Well maybe
He started singing
KMFE: Hah you're really one to talk
Everyone looked sort of awkward at that remark
They obviously thought KMFE was introducing some private detail of his feud with PL
PL: I imagine so
KMFE: OK that doesn't make sense
But I wasn't talking about me
PL: You were talking about me
KMFE: I mean not anything to do with me
PL: Who
KMFE: Don't worry about it
KMFE broke his own rules all the time
Officially he didn't think he should every publicly accuse PL of something major
Because seriously she deserved to be free from his influence
But then when she said something like that, he had a hard time just letting it go
Like the way she used to stereotype
There was that issue with the Debian version of SSH using insufficiently random private keys, which could potentially allow the keys to be cracked
And because it was Debian, it affected practically every SSH key on the planet, and was a big hassle to fix
PL: Brian complained about it loudly and he made me stay up with him while he changed all his SSH keys
KMFE: I think people are looking for an excuse to panic
It's not really a big deal unless you really care about security
PL: People at Case CARE about security
KMFE: I wish you wouldn't stereotype like that
Especially about engineering students
I happen to like engineering students
It wasn't that KMFE didn't think that the SSH keys were a big deal
It's that he didn't think it was really, honestly, a big deal to Brian
It was a big deal in principle, and it looks classy to care about that kind of principle
And of course PL loves an opportunity to turn an overtly nerdy exercise into a flirting session, and brag about it to KMFE
But really what bugged him was the generalization "People at Case CARE about security"
I mean they probably do
If you did a survey comparing Case to the general population, and looked at the aggregate numbers, you would probably see that people at Case showed increased concern for security by several orders of magnitude (depending on what kind of scale you used)
But the selective and persistent use of stereotypes and (admittedly hypothesized) comparisons to reinforce a general perception, itself a stereotype, just bugged KMFE
Worse was when he could see the motivation
KMFE, Eagle, and YD went outside while it was dark
The sun still obviously shown from one point in the sky, but it was not light out
During this time someone became visible walking through the tall grass behind the house
The sun was in KMFE's eyes as he tried to watch them go into the house
KMFE climbed up the stairs and sat on the top step
Jlml had told him that the visitor was very sick and had come looking for help
An ambulance and the police had been there
No one had told KMFE, but he thought the visitor had tried to commit suicide
However that was not what made him curious
He thought it was :P
The theory had to do with a message that had indirectly been delivered to him about the willow tree outside the house
In the chemistry lab back in New Ckrg, while moving large white cardboard boxes, someone had led him to believe that he was to meet someone under the branches
He was carrying two chickens under his arms
He walked up to a corner and whispered “orangutan”
From out of the shadows stepped Joe Siniger
They exchanged the chickens and some envelopes
Colin open the first envelope and gave Mr
Siniger a suspicious glare
Then he walked over to a locker and opened it
Mr
Daher stepped out wearing a bright pink flowery frilly towel
In the distance I could hear Mr
Ashcraft's deep melodic voice singing a song from “The Lion King”
Colin and Mr
Siniger drew their swords and began to fight, with Mr
Daher cheering them on
Later that afternoon I sent Colin an email inquiring about the episode
There was something markedly sinister about the whole ordeal and I couldn't let it go unexplored
Colin responded the next day with a carefully crafted catalog of enigmas
He warned me not to pry for deeper meaning, lest I uncover the secrets that might endanger my life, and the free world
I would not content myself with this caveat
How could I simply stand back in fear, while a parade of the unexplained and the inexplicable marched resolutely just beyond of my power for comprehension
It wasn't a big deal, and he figured he owed it to PL not to care
But what with all those times a few months ago with PL showing up at robotics and driving off with PL as :P lurked somewhere watching (because she does watch), and now showing up with PL at the party, KMFE just didn't want :P to think that he and PL were back together
Not a big deal, and it seemed kind of unfair to PL to make an issue of it, but there it was
It irritated him
Though he did not tell this to PL, because, well, he hadn't seen her in like forever, except for two days ago, which was really the heart of the problem
Like did PL know
I mean, did she know that she could bother KMFE by asking for a ride
Cause the timing was just so
careful
Anyway, KMFE arrived together, and they left together, and on the way back they were talking about names, and KMFE mentioned that Daniel means "judged by God", but that was it
Except somewhere in between KMFE borrowed a small piece of paper (and some pencil lead, but how do you repay a few words worth of pencil lead
And it was the first time he had seen n in over a year, and the last time he would probably ever
Somewhere else in there he didn't actually get to talk to :P much at all
What he didn't realize until much later, was that maybe, just a little, he owed it to :P to care
I mean, it was just really awesome how they got along in robotics, in a way that is hard to recall or describe now
And maybe KMFE should have at least not been afraid to show that actually he still cared about her
We weren't happy about her taking that class
And then she said it's a lot harder than it seems
It seemed pretty hard
And she gave that talk in Biology and Calculus
I wasn't sure what to talk about, so I made slides for every topic I could think of, so I could just wing it
I wasn't sure how careful I should be about talking to highschoolers
Should I not talk about hordes of drunk people on College Ave
I think I'll skip the racist comments I found scribbled in Frelinghuysen, and go with the more innocuous stall writing
At school I saw n
She was there with PL and WR
She had a hard time acknowledging my presence
But not in a bad way
The stories might suggest that n is not as amazing as I remember her
I discovered this to be completely wrong
I couldn't think about anything else
Later, with PL still there, n was drawing some graphs of polynomials to explain something, and that was the first time in almost a year that I talked to her directly
I don't remember what I said
But math makes it easier to talk
It's very objective
At first I thought she was telling some kind of a joke with the polynomials
But she wasn't and I didn't completely understand the explanation
But that wasn't important
The really nice thing is that she still fit my deepest memories of her
After getting home I ran to my computer to write her an email
I was somewhat embarrassed by it so I quickly hit send before I could think again
I wonder if I can still remember what it said
I knew his dad had taught him how to handle a gun, so he wasn't going to do something stupid, but it made me nervous with so many people around so I told him to put it down
Then he ran into the rhododendrons and I followed him
Under the rhododendrons it was wet and muddy, and our feet sank deep into the ground
Someone else had been through here recently and left footprints
The shape they left is something you tend to associate with cowboys or pirates
I told Cameron I wanted to follow the footprints and see where that person was going
We emerged from the rhododendrons right at the top edge of a cliff
Someone in big, inconveniently-shaped boots coming through too quickly could have easily fallen right off
I'm bad at judging heights but it looked like a long way down
I stood there for a while imagining how the story would have gone had I decided to just careen over the edge
Cameron was probably too young to think in terms of stories
Well there was no carcass at the bottom that I could see, so Pirate Boots hadn't killed himself
Cameron wanted to try climbing down the cliff but I was scared to, so I walked back through the rhododendrons to where the other people were, and Cameron followed
Then I noticed his boots were the same shape as the ones I had just followed to the cliff
Cameron, were those your footprints we were just following
I asked
Yeah, I thought you knew that, he said
Oh, I replied, not really having anything else to say
I was reassured to know that Pirate Boots was in no danger of falling to his death
But you should be careful not to put too much faith in any of the facts
Because while a lot of it's true, a lot of things that sound perfectly plausible and uninteresting are made up
And some true things are mixed with made up things
So just don't use it as evidence is I guess what I'll say
Actually, I am very careful about not trying to push people to get a certain impression from something
Because PL did that all the time
She really tried to control what things meant, and how people interpreted them, and especially how they interpreted her
And it really bugged me
Like the time we were cleaning out her room, and I came across something she wrote when she was like 10, so obviously not a good representation of her personality now, but still interesting in itself, and her only comment was "Can you see how much I've changed
Actually I've noticed a lot of people like to hide their past
I guess it makes sense
But it still strikes me as dishonest
There's a story that makes me wonder whether she had good reason to be afraid what people thought of her
This story also makes me cynical, a bit
But it's interesting for the curiosity, or like the questions it raises about what actually drives PL's behavior
So PL dated ll freshman year
And yes ll is gay, and I don't know if PL knew at the time, or even really if ll knew at the time, but anyway they were going out
PL really liked ll
I think ll was just scared of PL
So according to PL, ll got to know her a little bit, and things went OK
And then ll talked to some of PL's other friends
These weren't the group that had adopted ll, and that had given ll the prescribed impression of PL (oh look I'm being cynical already)
These were her other friends
The ones she used to play D&D with or something
Mostly guys
And from talking to this bunch of folks, ll got a totally different impression of who PL was
Now let me interject some commentary here, even though the story could go on perfectly well with just the facts, because I want to correct PL's interpretation of events before she gives it
I don't think that either view of PL, the one construed by the first group, or the one construed by the D&D crowd, is "correct"
Or, really, they're both correct in some ways
She maybe could choose to be just one or the other if she tried, but she hasn't done that, and anyway that wouldn't really change much fundamentally
Basically, people appear different in different contexts, and none if it's wrong, and none of it's right
It's just different
PL says that at that point ll completely changed his behavior towards her
And that upset her
She believed that ll got a good bit of the wrong impression about her
From the way she told the story, it sounded like the impression ll got from the D&D crowed seemed unfamiliar even to PL
It was like hearing about a different person
So she regrets that
She thinks it hurt her relationship with ll
And she doesn't want that repeated
So now she's careful to control what information people get about her
But is that really how she wants to interact with people
As this Machiavellian construction
And more than that: is it really fair to other people
Shouldn't they be allowed to see what they're getting themselves into
Well I kind of feel like I got duped by her carefully controlled image
I didn't like it
I don't know if that matters to her
