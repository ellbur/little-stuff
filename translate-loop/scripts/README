== Other Software ==

The scripts here use the python interpreter. They make use of the following
python libraries:
 - csv
 - re
 - optparse
I used python version 2.6.4

The scripts need to call an external program called 'translate-bin'. It is
part of the Debian package libtranslate-bin or may be obtained from
http://www.nongnu.org/libtranslate/ .

== Files ==

loop.py
Prints out the complete cycle resulting from an input sentence. Output is
printed to STDOUT.

Usage: loop.py: [OPTIONS] <sentence>

Options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -f FROM_LANGUAGE  Form language, two letter code
  -t TO_LANGUAGE    To language, two letter code
  -s SERVICE        Translation service (see translate-bin)

find_many.py
Reads lines from STDIN. For each line, find the resulting cycle. Prints
results to STDOU as a comma-separated-value table.

Usage: find_many.py: [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -f FROM_LANGUAGE  Form language, two letter code
  -t TO_LANGUAGE    To language, two letter code
  -s SERVICE        Translation service (see translate-bin)

== Examples ==

For a list of sentences stored in a file called 'sentences.txt', find the
period of each one and output to 'sentence-periods.csv':
$ cat sentences.txt | ./find_many.py > sentence-periods.csv

Same as above, except from English to French:
$ cat sentences.txt | ./find_many.py -f en -t fr > sentence-periods.csv

Look at the cycle starting with 'He looked straight ahead' from English to
Spanish:
$ ./loop.py -f en -t es 'He looked straight ahead'

Which will print out:
en <--> es
1 after 1
  He looked straight ahead
  He looked forward *
  He looked forward *
