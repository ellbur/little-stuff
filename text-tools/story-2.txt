A runner and a bycicle go past.

It was down the street: "I see a kite like a dove. Look out the window."
I led him to it.
"A kite has a dull challenge. He could have better adversaries than gravity."

We were picturing the same thing.
At last he raised the thought: "Did you see my roommate?"
I did not say.
Then him trying again, "Which way was he going?"
"To the structure."
"Structure?"
"Just off campus. That construction."
"The monuments. You can see a lot from up there. I have to go."
"Chasing him?"
"Gotta try."

We were raised never to know what we can't control. A thousand spirits unfolding in my mind. Outside horns dress the air quenching silence. Neon cosmos? Then nothing but time.

'The monuments'? The name was his. 'Time executes monuments. History will grow old and die.' Or did he tell me 'time executes idols?' 'time kidnapped my friends?' It was yesterday... I was not listening.

I met him at seven. Today was forgotten for me. He called my name.
"I never loved before the exhileration of falling. The air is countless luminous explosions. Gravity breaths daylight -- I will learn reverance for mystery."
"In pain?"
He was smiling.
"Just a little."
"The fairy? The runner?"
Silence a moment, always smiling.
"It was someone else. Because anyone can conjure dreams."
