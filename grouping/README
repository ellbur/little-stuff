Matlab code to group things based on similarity.

To compare files, the program 'bzip2' must be installed. It will work best on
text files.

A test set of files is in ./test-files/ . It's a rather cheap set, because
it contains some very, very different types of files (and the program still
messes up occasionally).

The algorithm is still a work in progress. It usually handles small groups
correctly, but not usually large groups (more than 30 it rarely gets right).
The other interpretation is that it is always right, and you're just wrong
about what you thought it should do.
