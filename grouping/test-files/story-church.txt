“Darn they have a chain in front of the church” TDCP complained to Jo.
“Well we can just step over it.”
“There's probably some sort of construction going on. The whole place could be a mess.”

Jo crawled under the chain and knocked on the door. “It doesn't look like a Presbyterian Church” she observed.

Jo forced open the door and walked in. TDCP waited about a minute and then followed her. Inside there were indeed signs of construction, with some plywood on a table and sawdust everywhere.

“Do you think GL will find this place?” TDCP asked.
“I hope not.”
“Aw come on. GL can't annoy you that much.”
“No she's just too good.”
